No other written information seemed to be available among the Garner descendants. Therefore, the writer began a search of church history records. The findings were both amazing and thrilling. In order that we might fully appreciate the supreme sacrifice made by our ancestors for the sake of the gospel, those findings are now carefully compiled in the following life sketch.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Dora D. </strong>(Could this D. stand for Durfee?) <strong>Flack, 448 East 775 North, Bountiful, Utah</strong>) (Notice in the above paragraph that Edmund Durfee is Dolly Durfee's father <strong>not her husband.</strong> Her husband is David Garner. Dolly's <strong>mother</strong> is <strong>Magdalena Pickle.</strong> Keep this in mind as you go through the following material.)\n</p>\n<p>\n(Jim, this is not really the life story of these two people. It is just a compilation of what has been written about them in various sources.)\n</p>\n<p>\nA LIFE SKETCH OF EDMUND DURFEE AND LANA PICKLE DURFEE\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund Durfee was born in Tiverton, Newport County, Rhode Island. (Both spellings of Edmond are used in the records.) Five generations before him Thomas Durfee (born in 1643) immigrated to America from England. He settled in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. His youngest son, Benjamin, moved to Tiverton where the descendants remained until the time of Edmund, who was born October 3, 1788, the son of Perry Durfee and Annie Salisbury (Sulsbury).\n</p>\n<p>\nHow and where Edmund and Lana (Magdalena)Pickle became acquainted we do not know. At any rate Edmund married Lana Pickle about 1810. To date we have not found the exact date. She was born June 6, 1788 in Montgomery County, New York, the daughter of John and Dolly Pickle (I think there is an error here. My records show Magdalena (Lana) Pickle's parents to be John Pickle and Magdalena Saltzman. Dolly is a daughter of John and Lana and she married David Garner. Could Magdalena Saltzman have been nicknames \"Dolly\" I don't know, but her (1)last name couldn't have been Pickle. That was her father's name - John Pickle) Oh, oh, just looked at their - Edmund and Lana Pickle's - family group sheet. I'm sending it to you. Down at the bottom of the sheet it says that Lana was also called Dolly. I guess that is why they named their daughter Dolly. However, Lana was not Dolly Pickle she had to be Dolly Saltzman. Her daughter would have been Dolly Pickle.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund and Lana settled in Lennox, Madison County, New York where the following children were born: Martha born Nov. 17, 181l; Tamma born Mar.  6, 1813, Edmund born Sept. 4, 1814 Dolly born Mar. 8, 1816, John born Jan. 31, 1818, Lana or Delana born Feb. 14 (or is it the 4th), 1820\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout 1822 the family moved to Amboy, Oswego County, New York, where Edmund bought land, built a house, and cultivated a small farm. He also worked-at his trade as a carpenter and millwright. Maple trees abounded in that area, so he bought more land with many maple trees on it. Of course, they made a great deal of maple sugar. For eight happy years the family enjoyed their home in Amboy. Twelve children had been welcomed into the Durfee famly. Those born at Amboy were: William born Sept. 15, 1822, Ephraim born June 1, 1824, Abraham born Nov. 14, 1826, Henry born in 1827, Jabez born May 10, 1828, and Mary born Mar. 21, 1830.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, at that time the west was opening up and Edmund felt that opportunities were many in the new territory. So in June 1830 he sold his sugar bush and farm, and the family moved to Ohio. They travelled through Camden Village to the canal which took them to Buffalo. They crossed Lake Superior and landed at Portland. From there they moved on to Huron County and settled in the township of Ruggles. There Edmund bought property, and the Durfees made Ruggles their new home. B\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the winter of 1831 rumors began circulating about Joseph Smith and a gold Bible. In April Solomon Hancock arrived in the community. The =~ Durfees were Methodists. Often Elder Hancock preached in their chapel telling them how the Lord had sent the Angel Moroni to Joseph Smith. He explained the beautiful truths of the restored gospel. They were admonished to learn the truth, for it was much different from the rumors they had heard before hand. The gospel message found its way to the heart of Edmund and Lana and their family. Edmund was baptized in May 1831, by Simeon Carter and Lana was baptized June 1 by Solomon Hancock. Most of the children also accepted the gospel and were baptized during those months. Because Tamma was going with a young man who reportedly wouldn't have a Mormon wife, she quietly believed without being baptized until after their marriage in August.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Journal History of the Church on Tuesday, October 25, 1831, are recorded \"Minutes of a General Conference of the Church at the dwelling of Brother Serenes Burnett in the town of Orange, Cayahoga County, Ohio, 39 members present: High Priests Joseph Smith Jr., Oliver Cowdery, J. Whitmer, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Ridgon, Samuel Smith, Simeon Carter, Reynolds Cahoon, Martin Harris, Joseph Smith, Sen., Wheeler Baldwin, John Smith, Elders David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Sylvester Smith, Luke S. Johnson, B....Riggs, Sylvester Baker, Orson Hyde, Daniel Stanton, Joseph Brackenbury, William E. McLellan, Major N. Ashley, Stephen Burnett, Edmund Durfee, Joel Johnson, Levi Jackman, Emer Morris, Frederick G. Williams, Priests Lyman E. Johnson, Edmund Johnson, Benjamin Carpenter, Rugg Eames, Teachers William Smith, Uriel Stephens, Hyrum Griffith, Deacons Titus Billings, Serene Burnett, and John....... ?\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of the brethren spoke at that time and their ideas were recorded in the minutes.....\"Brother Edmund Durfee said that he also had professed religion for a number of years; yet now he felt to bear testimony of the goodness of God and also consecrate all to the Lord.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"At the evening session of the conference a number were called and ordained High Priests. After prayer President Smith said that he had a testimony that each had a talent and if, after being ordained he should hide it, God would take it away from them. He exhorted them to pray continually in meekness and said that those who previously had been ordained priests would be ordained elders and so on.....Edmund Durfee was made a High Priest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn December Edmund left on a mission for the church. So just before leaving he baptized his daughter, Tamma. The following February the elders cut a hole in the ice and baptized her husband, which united all the family as members of the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund accompanied Elder Joseph E. Brachenbury on his mission to Chautauqua County, New York. Quoting from Journal History we find: \"In the fall of 1831 Joel H. and Davis Johnson who had received the gospel in Amherst, Ohio, brought the Book of Mormon to their relatives in Chautauqua County, New York. Soon afterward Joel Johnson and Almon W. Babbitt (then only a boy) came to the same neighborhood as missionaries and were followed by two high priests, namely Edmund Durfee and Jos. B.  Brackenbury. 'Elder Brackenbury was an earnest and powerful preacher,\u2019 likewise Elder Benjamin Pore)Johnson' and all the elders sent were filled with the spirit of the Lord.\" Many received their testimony and my mother, Lyman R. Shearman, a brother-in-law were the first to be baptized. After a few weeks of successful preaching and baptizing Elder Brackenbury was taken violently sick and within a few days, Jan. 7, 1832, died of the billious cholic.'\n</p>\n<p>\nHistory of the Church concerning this event reads, as follows: \"Elder Joseph B. Brackenbury died at Pomfret from the effects of poison secretly administered to him by opposers, who afterwards boasted that Mormon elders had not faith enough to stand poison. The night after his burial there was a heavy snowstorm.- About half past eleven o'clock Joel H. Johnson dreamed that the persons were digging up Brother Brackenbury's body, and was so exercised about it that he called up some of the brethren and went to the spot, about one mile distant, and found a party of doctors at work, who had nearly cleared the grave of earth; the men fled with utmost precipitation. David Johnson took after the largest one who was caught and bound over in one thousand dollar bonds for his appearance at court, but was never tried.(4)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Temple site at Jackson County, Missouri, was dedicated August 3, 1831.  The saints were looking forward to establishment of \"Zion\". Consequently settlements were established in that area (Far-West). In accordance with instructions in Feb. 1832, Edmund went down to establish his claim in \"Zion\" and to build a place for his family, returning home May 20. However, the family did not move at that time because Edmund was called on another mission back to the states, which occupied his time until fall.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe following spring in May the family moved to Kirtland where most of the saints were gathering. At Kirtland when Lana was 47 years old, her thirteenth child, Nephi, was born on July 22, 1835.\n</p>\n<p>\nRevelation had been given to Joseph to build a House to the Lord in Kirtland.  Ground was broken June 5, 1833. Immediately work began and the cornerstones were laid the following month. On July 23 Edmund was one of the 24 elders who laid the cornerstones. The saints worked eagerly on the Temple at every opportunity. Edmund spent a great deal of his time in the construction of that beautiful edifice. Likewise his brother Jabez spent much time on the temple as a carver and decorator. Although it was a critical period, no sacrifice was too great in time or money. On Saturday, March 7, 1835, as the Temple was nearing completion, a meeting was called for the purpose of blessing in the name of the Lord those who had assisted in building by their labor and other means the House of the Lord in Kirtland.  The morning was occupied by Pres. Jos. Smith, Jr. in teaching the church the propriety and necessity of purifying itself. In the afternoon the names of those who had assisted to build the house were taken and further instructions received from President Smith. He said that those who had distinguished themselves thus far by consecrating to the upbuilding of the House of the Lord as well as laboring thereon were to be remembered that those who built it should own it and have the control of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"After further remarks those who performed the labor on the building voted unanimously that they would continue to laber thereon till the House should be completed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n\"President Sidney Rigdon was appointed to lay on hands and bestow blessings in the name of the Lord. The Presidents were blessed; and Reynolds Cahoon, Hyrum Smith and Jared Carter, the building committee thereof (the last two were not present, yet their rights in the House were preserved).\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The following are the names of those who were blessed in consequence of their labor on the House of the Lord in Kirland and those who consecrated to its upbuilding:....(Edmund Durfee, Sen. and Edmund Durfee, Jr. were among those named.)....All those who were blessed were given the blessings of heaven and a right in the House of the Lord in Kirtland agreeable to the labor they had performed thereon and the means they had contributed.! They were also promised wisdom and ability to proclaim the gospel. Edmund Durfee, Jr.  (5)was ordained an elder. A James Durfee was also blessed on this occasion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Temple was finally completed - truly a great monument to the faith of a small group of people who built in their poverty at a time when violence threatened them on every side.\n</p>\n<p>\nMarch 27, 1836 was indeed a memorable occesion - the Temple was dedicated! Edmund felt fully repaid for all his effort. \"Angels were present and the Holy Spirit, like the sound of a mighty rushing of wind fell upon the house and assembly. The people of the neighborhood came running together, hearing a strange sound and seeing a bright light resting on the Temple. The (6)House had been accepted by the Lord.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe financial panic of 1837 heightened insecurity. At the same time feelings against the Mormons rose to a new pitch. As a result the saints were driven from Kirtland. The Durfees hastened to Caldwell County, Missouri, settling (7)in Log Creek.\n</p>\n<p>\nApostacy was rampant in the church. Denial of the church brought relief from persecution. Misunderstandings were many and the general spirit was one of contention even within the church. Even those who were next to the Prophet himself often lost their light and understanding.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The saints assembled at Edmund Durfee Settlement in Caldwell County, Missouri, agreeable to appointment and rejected Presidents David Whitmer and William W. Phelps by unanimous vote as the Presidency of the church in (8)Missouri. Similar meeting were also held at the various settlements.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Whitmer and W. W. Phelps were charged with selling possessions in Jackson County, contrary to revelations of the Lord, which was paramount to denial of the faith; also for misappropriaton of funds borrowed for the use of the church. David Whitmer was charged with even more offenses. The Lord in a revelation had rebuked these men for their transgression and warned- them, but they did not heed the warning. Thomas Marsh and David W.  Patten were sustained as presiding officers in Missouri until the coming of President Smith and Rigdon. W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer were excommunicated March 10, 1838 with David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery held over for investigation. Both were excommunicated later.\n</p>\n<p>\nImprisonments were numerous and always on false charges. Satan himself seemed to have been turned loose, determined to destroy the church and people of God. - Mobocrates, with Governor Boggs at their head had no respect for private property. Homes were entered by force. All weapons were forcibly taken from the Mormons even to butcher knives, so that they had no means of self-defense. Men were dragged from their homes and families and were brutally beaten, tarred and feathered, and abused in every conceivable way. No forces of government gave them redress. for these wrongs. Without hope of ever getting anything from their properties, they were finally expelled from Missouri by Nov. 1838.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund took his family and settled in Yelrome near Lima, Illinois, where they tried to find peace and the privilege of living unmolested. The church was built up considerably. The \"Lima Branch Records\" p. 385 under date of March 12, 1843 read: \"Edmund Durfee was received in full fellowship by the Lima Branch by vote.\" This record was signed by Isaac Morley, President, and James C. Snow, Clerk.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the appointing of the High Council, Elder Heber C. Kimball made some general remarks upon the Word of Wisdom. He said God looked into the heart of a man. He said some would strain nip, and tuck at the Word of Wisdom, but would turn away a poor brother when he would ask for a little meal for breakfast. He compared it to the man that was stretched upon the iron bedstead,; if he was too long they would cut him off, if he was too short they would stretch him out; and again he said it made him think of the old Indian's tree which stood so straight that it leaned a little the other way and the best way was to stand erect.\" He also made some very appropriate (11)remarks with regard to the Temple and Nauvoo House.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe beautiful city of Nauvoo rose from swampland into the largest city of Illinois at that time. The majestic temple rose steadily in the midst of sacrifice and continued persecution. Still the saints looked to Joseph as their guide. Tamma tells that they listened to the Prophet speak for five hours straight and no one was tired.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom a record of baptisms for the dead made at Morley's Settlement, on November 7, 1840 and November 14, 1840, Edmund and Lana were baptized for his parents, Perry and Annie Salisbury Durfee, and for her parents, John and Dolly??? Pickle. (See Vol. 210 p. 385, Historian's Office.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe very foundations of Mormonism shook when the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were martyred at Carthage on June 27, 1844. Confusion crowded the minds of the saints when the decision of new leadership was to be made. At a special meeting held on March 8, the question was answered unequivocally when Brigham Young stood before them to discuss the matter.  To their amazement he stood transfigured before their very eyes. It seemed they saw the Prophet Joseph before them and heard his voice as naturally as ever although it was Brigham Young speaking. Although many divisions occurred in the church at that time Edmund and Lana remained steadfast in their faith, choosing to follow the Quorum of the Twelve.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoseph had prophesied that the saints would eventually seek refuge in the tops of the mountains. Persecution continued, hastening the time of that long trek.  All efforts were turned toward outfitting wagons, laying up supplies, and preparing themselves in every way. Needless to say the constant trouble did not hasten the preparations, although the mobocrats continued to scream that the Mormons must move, and the sooner the better.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the plan of the mob not to gather in large bodies but to burn Yelrome, then attack some other place and finally drive all the Mormons into Nauvoo.  That being accomplished they planned to move them from Nauvoo by help from other areas. Accordingly everyone was driven out of Morley's Settlement (Yelrome). Sheriff Jacob B. Backenstos wrote the following proclamation which describes the conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"September 13, 1845.....To the citizens of Hancock County, Whereas a mob of from 100 to 200 men under arms have gathered themselves together in the sourthwest part of Hancock County and are at this time destroying the dwellings and other buildings, stacks of grain and other property of a portion of the citizens and in the most inhuman manner compelling defenseless children and women to rise from their sick beds and exposing them to the rays of the parched sun and to lie and suffer without the aid and assistance of a friendly hand to minister to their wants in their suffering condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The riotous spare not the widow nor the orphan and while I am writing this proclamation the smoke is rising to the clouds, and the flames are devouring four buildings which have been set on fire by the rioters. Thousands of dollars worth of property have already been consumed; an entire settlement of about 60 or 70 families laid waste, the inhabitants thereof fired upon (12)narrowly escaping with their lives and forced to flee before the mob.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe went on to call attention to the law and its penalties for infractions.  Although he tried earnestly to discharge his responsibility, no help came to enforce the laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund's home was among those burned to the ground. Tamma tells how her young brother (Nephi, aged 10) was simply rolled in his sick bed and thrown outdoors. The mobbers then went to the haystack, got two bundles of oats, put a firebrand in them, threw them on top of the house and said they would return in the morning. Finally that work of destruction was complete, and almost the whole town was smoldering in ruins and ashes.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom Nauvoo rushed 134 teams travelling all night and day to rescue the homeless families and take them to Nauvoo. The troublemakers agreed that the saints could return to harvest their crops. Therefore, a month later Edmund and others returned to gather their crops and harvest the grain which they needed so badly for the anticipated journey. On the 15th of November \"near Solomon Hancock's house about midnight a stack of straw was discovered on fire. Several persons turned out to suppress the flames; while thus engaged a whistle was heard east and one west; presently a gun was fired then and they continued to fire till six guns were discharged at them, the ball of the fourth one entered the body of Edmund Durfee just above the heart and he died instantly.\" His body was immediately taken to Nauvoo for burial.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe \"Nauvoo Neighbor\" put out an \"extra\" on November 19th concerning this tragic incident, A part of it is quoted:\n</p>\n<p>\n\"As may be seen by the affidavits below, it falls to our painful lot to chronicle two more outrages upon the lives and rights of the Latter-day Saints, since they have been using all diligence to secure their crops, build wagons, and leave next spring.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Mr. Durfee was one of the most industrious, inoffensive and good men that could be found, and having his house burnt in September last, moved to Nauvoo and went on Saturday last for a load of grain, was shot dead in cold blood, at midnight while striving with others to save property from the flames by an armed mob!\n</p>\n<p>\n..... \"Have nearly two thousand five hundred wagons commenced for our Pacific journey next spring, but such outrages certainly are not calculated to aid us in getting ready. We have borne the Missouri persecution; we have mourned the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith; we feel the destruction of one or two hundred houses the present season, and our hearts are pained at the murder of Edmund Durfee, because he was a good man; but, we, as in all cases of the saints, leave the disposition of these matters in the care of a wise God, and the perpetrators, to the mercy of (as they say), a country of laws, and be those laws honored or disgraced we cannot be charged with revenge; and we do beseech the people and the authorities not to impute crime to us, to raise excitement, when we see our accusers wiping the blood of innocent men, women, and children, from their (13)garments, as though this was the realm of Nero.....\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOn November 17 Orson Hyde (the presiding authority in Nauvoo), who had known Edmund for many years, wrote a letter to Brigham Young informing him of the incident. Among other things he said: \"Mr. Durfee was one of the most quiet and inoffensive citizens in these United States and from our acquaintance with him and from the nature of his business in securing his (14)crops we are persuaded that his murder was wholly unprovoked.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Edmund's death \"the mob boasted that they fired at Durfee on a bet of a gallon of whiskey that they could kill him with the first shot and they won.\"  The guilty parties were not hard to identify - they were identified by Edmund's companions. Although they were apprehended and affidavite filed concerning the incident, they were released by the magistrate without examination - another evidence of the legal farces which met all the grievances of the saints.\n</p>\n<p>\nNo one could possibly understand the grief and terror which must have filled Lana's heart at such a tragedy. Even in Nauvoo the reign of terror persisted.  All her children were married with the exception of Jabez (apparently named for Edmund's brother) and Nephi. On January 21, 1846, she received her endowments in the upper rooms of the Nauvoo Temple and was also sealed to Edmund on that date. Edmund's endowment date is January 4, 1882 (by proxy in the Endowment House.)\n</p>\n<p>\nDue to the conditions surrounding her, the insecurity and constant danger, it is not surprising that Lana married her brother-in-law, Jabez Durfee -(This then had to be Edmund's brother, not their son. Lana asked Celestia Curtis to marry her son Jabez), on January 21, 1846 (for time). Jabez's first wife, Electra Cranston, had died in 1834 at Independence, Missouri, during the Missouri mob trouble. six (and possibly seven) of the Durfee children received their endowments in the Nauvoo Temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce again expulsion faced the Durfees. Apparently Lana and Jabez and her two boys left Nauvoo with the main body of the saints. At that she is not mentioned as having remained in Nauvoo as did Tamma and one ...... as related in Tamma's \"Memorial\". At Musketol Creek, Council Bluffs, Iowa, Lana died on Mar 17, 1850, at the age of 62. After her death Jabez did not continue the journey to Utah but died at White Cloud, Iowa in April 1867(the family group sheet has him dying April 1868. This needs to be checked.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFew parents have given their descendants such a rich heritage of faithfulness and devotion to the cause of truth. May this history serve to perpetuate that faith in the hearts of those who follow after them.\n</p>\n<p>\n****************************\n</p>\n<p>\nThroughout the records various names and spellings were given for Lana - Delaney, Lainey,Laney, Delana, and Lanna.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome doubt exists as to the correct birthplace of Lana (probably a contraction of Magdelena). While many of the members of the family conclude that Lana was born in Rhode Island because her husband was born there, the old manuscript dictated by Tamma reads: \"Laney Pickle born June 6, 1768 in Holland and died May 17, 1856 in Council Bluffs.\"(This information on Laney Pickle does not agree with the information on that family's family group sheet. It needs to be checked further.) She may prove to be a descendant from the Pickle (originally spelled Pechtel or Bechtel family of Columbia Co., N.Y.)

Most of these, however, located northeast of Lima, in the extreme south end of Hancock County in which is now Walker Township on and around a townsite which had been surveyed and named Yelrome. This little town situated 2 1/2 miles northeast of Lima was also known as Morley Town or Morley's Settlement in honor of Isaac Morley, the presiding church officer residing there. At a conference held at Lima October 23, 1842 the branch was represented to consist of 424 members. Yelrome or Morley's Settlement was nearly burnt out by the mob in the fall of 1845 and the saints were all compelled to leave the following year in 1946. A new town called Tioga was laid out on the old townsite which at present consists of an unimportant village.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n11 Journal History, Sunday, June 11, 1843; also \"History of the Church,\" Vol.  7, pp 427-29<br />\n12 \"History of the Church,\"\u201d Vol. 7, page 529.<br />\n13 Ibid. pp. 528-9<br />\n14 Ibid p. 525<br />\n15 Ibid p. 524\n</p>\n<p>\nCompiled and written in March 1955, by Dora D.

Be so good as to inform us so soon as convenient.\n</p>\n<p>\nAffidavits will probably soon reach you of the above transactions.\n</p>\n<p>\nVery Respectfully, in behalf of the Council,<br />\n(signed) Orson Hyde\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\nTuesday, 18. The Twelve met in council at Dr. Richards\u2019. Mr. Brayman, attorney for the state, wrote a letter to the council desiring witnesses against the murderers of Durfee to be sent to Carthage, also affidavits forwarded in relation to the burning of Rice\u2019s house, and advising us of the arrest of George Backman, Moss and Snyder, who were charged with the murder of Elder ~ Edmund Durfee, Sen.  <br />\nThe council replied immediately and requested the witnesses to start in the morning for Carthage to perform their part in another judicial farce.\n</p>\n<p>\nNAUVOO NEIGHBOR - EXTRA<br />\nNauvoo, November 19th, 1845\n</p>\n<p>\nMURDER AND ARSON<br />\nEDMUND DURFEE SHOT - TWO HOUSES BURNED\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cAs may be seen by the affidavits below, it falls to our painful lot to chronicle two more outrages upon the lives and rights of the Latter-day Saints, since they have been using all diligence to secure their crops, build wagons, and leave next spring.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Durfee was one of the most industrious, inoffensive and good men that could be found, and having his house burnt in September last, moved to Nauvoo and went on Saturday last for a load of grain, was shot dead in cold blood, at midnight while striving with others to save property from the flames by an armed mob!\n</p>\n<p>\nAs to the destruction of the houses and property, and the treatment on that occasion - let the affidavit speak for itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018We have nearly two thousand five hundred wagons commenced for our Pacific journey next spring, but such outrages certainly are not calculated to aid us in getting ready. We have borne the Missouri persecution; we have mourned the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith; we feel the destruction of one or two hundred houses the present season, and our hearts are pained at the murder of Edmund Durfee, because he was a good man; but, we, as in all cases of the saints, leave the disposition of these matters in the care of a wise God, and the perpetrators, to the mercy of (as they say), a country of laws, and be those laws honored or disgraced we cannot be charged with revenge; and we do beseech the people and the authorities not to impute crime to us, to raise excitement, when we see our accusers wiping the blood of innocent men, women and children, from their garments as though this was the realm of Nero.\n</p>\n<p>\nAFFIDAVIT 1 THE DURFEE MURDER CASE\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cState of Illinois<br />\nHancock County\n</p>\n<p>\nPersonally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson a justice of the peace within and foresaid county, James H.

The Twelve met and prayed.<br />\nCOURSE OF MAJOR WARREN REPORTED - BACKENSTOS\n</p>\n<p>\nSheriff Backenstos came into council about 7 p.m., and said that he had watched Major Warren very closely for the last four days, though he had turned Jack-Mormon, that he had been very busy and energetic in arresting the murderers of Durfee and the burners of Rice\u2019s house, that he had several of them under guard at Carthage and was in pursuit of more and had chased one of them into Missouri and forced him back at the point of the pistol without any requisition from the governor. He admitted to Backenstos that Durfee would not have been murdered had the troops not been in the county; notwithstanding Governor Ford\u2019s late letter to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p>\nMonday, 24. Ten a.m., Brother Heber C. Kimball and I called at the Historian\u2019s Office and read history with Dr. Richards and George A. Smith.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe council wrote Elder Theodore Turley who is now in jail awaiting his examination.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have learned that the persons who murdered Edmund Durfee as also those who burned Rice\u2019s and Hick\u2019s houses were discharged by the magistrate without examination. Our brethren went according to Major Warren and Mr. Brayman\u2019s request as witnesses thereby fulfilling their part towards magnifying and making the laws honorable, but returned unheard, and the farce closed sooner than he had anticipated, without even a grand jury on the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nA Short Story of the Life of Ida M. Rollins Hamblin<br />\nby Ida M. Rollins\n</p>\n<p>\nI was born of goodly parents in a very primitive cottonwood log house with a dirt roof on the 2nd day of October 1862 in a small pioneer village situated on the banks of the Bear River in the southwestern part of Utah. The place derived its name Minersville on account of their being so many miners in that locality. My parents were James Henry Rollins, born in Lima New York on the 27th day of May 1816, and Eveline Walker Rollins, born the 16th of May 1823 in or near Dayton, Ohio. They were early Pioneers of Utah immigrating from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters in February 1846 \u2014 lived there through the year 1847 and from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City \u2014 arrived there in October 1848.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the time of the great gold rush to California in 1849, Father went to California in company with Charles C. Rich and Amasa Lyman. At this same time, George Q.  Cannon accompanied them on his way to the Hawaiian Islands as a missionary for the LDS Church. Father returned from California in 1850 bringing a considerable amount of gold dust which he had obtained with him. At this time flour was very scarce in Utah and I have heard him say he went all over Salt Lake trying to trade gold dust for flour but there was none to be had. I have heard Mother say before Father came back from California that she had some mildewed corn meal and she would make bread of it and they would have to hold their noses while they ate it. The odor was so offensive.\n</p>\n<p>\nBrigham Young called a few of the families to go to California and found a Colony. So in the spring of 1857 Father moved with his family to California in company with C.C. Rich and Amasa Lyman. While Father was gone, he left Mother with three small children, the youngest just a few months old. They hired a young English girl, Hannah Humes, an orphan whose father had died at sea on his way to Utah. Her mother had died in England. When they went to go to California, Hannah wanted to go with them. Father asked President Young whether he should take her or not and he advised Father to bring her to the Endowment House and have her sealed to him, which he did on the 3rd of March 1851.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather helped to found the city of San Bernardino and was the first merchant there, establishing a store on the spot where there is a large post office building at the present time. They were called back to Utah in 1858 at the time of the invasion of the Johnston\u2019s Army. Enroute home from California, Mother got frightened by some Indians at Santa Clara, Utah and it caused her to be very sick. She lost a baby girl which was premature and her life was dispared of. But by the administration of the Elders, she survived and they traveled on until they came to Cedar City. Father tried to obtain a house there to lie in but failed and they traveled on the Parowan to stop for a while until Mother got strong enough to travel on to Salt Lake which was their destination. But while there, the Brethren got word from Brigham Young for them to stay in the southern part of Utah and help to strengthen the settlements of the south. So they lived in Parowan for two years.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1860 Father was called to go to Minersville to be the Bishop of that place.  While living in California, Mother gave birth to two sons. Charles Lyman was born the 10th of November 1854 and James Watson was born May 24, 1856. Father's other wife, Hannah, gave birth to three children. The first was a boy baby which only lived a day and Caroline and George who were born the 19th of March 1856. While living in Parowan, Hannah gave birth to a son, Robert Francis, born the 18th of November 1858.  Father moved his wife Hannah over to Minersville in 1860 and later moved Mother over.  Hannah lost her little girl Caroline in Minersville when she was eight years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was my Mother\u2019s tenth child, four of them dying while small. I spent my childhood days in Minersville. I attended school there and learned my ABC's there, as it was then called. The first school that I remember attending was taught by my father's sister, Mary E. Lightner. She taught in an old adobe meeting house which was used for church and all kinds of amusements and a school house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy Grandmother Walker lived with my mother\u2019s sister, Dionitia Walker Lyman.  The night I was born, Mother sent my brother Watson up to stay with Grandmother.  When it was time for him to come back home, Grandmother pleaded with Mother to let him stay there. So he lived there nine years until Grandmother died. I stayed there a great deal of the time as I liked to be with my Grandmother. When I was seven years old, my sister Melissa got married to John N. Lee of Panaca, Nevada. After that, Mother and I would try and make a trip to see her every year if she did not come to visit us.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy father was the first post master in Minersville. He also kept the first stage station and a Tavern, as a hotel was called. I first learned to read writing as I was handing out letters in the Post Office when Father wasn't in. He was Post Master for a great many years.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather found and owned in with several others the first lead mine in Utah. A Brother Issiac Grundy built a primitive shelter on the north bank of the Beaver River and run out lead bars of 1 Lb and 5 lbs. Father would freight the lead bars to Salt Lake and sell it to make bullets and white lead.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather and Albert Stoddard bought and installed a molasses mill and the people in town raised sugar cane. They would bring the cane to them and they would run the cane through a mill and get the juice. They had several large vats which were built over a furnace. They would put the juice in these vats and boil it down to molasses. As it boiled they would have to skim it. We children would have a great time. We would get the skimmings and make candy of it. The women folk would make vinegar of it also.  We never knew what it was to buy vinegar. Mother had a 5 gallon keg and she always kept it full.\n</p>\n<p>\nMother made candles out of tallow. I remember the first coal oil lamp we ever had. Mother was afraid to light it for fear it would blow up. She had a spinning wheel and loom to weave cloth on. She spun the yarn and dyed it. I remember she made me a plaid woolen dress, and herself and the other children clothes. She made yarn and knit all our stockings. She also gathered saleratus from the ground (we call it alkali now) and would make soap of it to last all winter. Thus the pioneers would work and save everything. To make a living she would also gather straw and braid our hats. We felt very proud of our straw hats.\n</p>\n<p>\nI attended the schools which were held about three months of the year called a quarter. The teachers would charge three to four dollars apiece for each student which they would take in produce of all kinds and some would have wood to pay their tuition.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 10 or 11, my brother Charles was called as a missionary to the border between Utah and Arizona to build a fort at a place called Lee\u2019s Ferry on the Colorado River against the Navajo Indians. I remember they, the Indians, came up as far as Minersville and would run off the horses and cattle. Before this time, Jacob Hamblin had been called down there to try and make peace with the Indians. Oscar Hamblin, my husband\u2019s father accompanied him with his family and settled at Santa Clara where Wallace and William twins were born April 27, 1862. Several years after Charles returned home, he was married to Miss Ada Dotson. I kept on attending school and when about 13 or 14 we had some very good school teachers. I attended these schools until I was in the 5th reader. That was how the grades were determined in those days.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had several teachers that came from the B.Y. Academy at Provo. They enthused me so much telling me what a wonderful school it was, that I was so thrilled about it I wanted to go there. At the Christmas holidays in 1880, Apostle F.M. Lyman and his son F.M. Lyman Jr. came to our house on their way back from a holiday vacation to Parowan. F.M. Jr. was a student at B.Y.A. I asked my parents if I could go back with them and attend the B.Y.A. in Provo. They consented to let me go so I got ready in a hurry. This was my first trip away from home alone. Sometimes I would get very homesick, but that wonderful old man, Karl G. Maeser, was so kind. When he would find a student that was blue and homesick, he would put his arms around you and cheer you up and make you feel alright. I only stayed there in Provo until the April Conference. I attended conference and then returned home on account of being short of funds.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile there, I boarded with one of Heber C. Kimball's wives, Lucy Walker Kimball. I assisted in the kitchen mornings and evenings as part pay for my room and board. She allowed me $1.00 per week for my work and I paid $3.00 per week cash. I roomed with four other girls namely, Saddie Sheppard of Beaver, Utah who afterward became the wife of Rhinard Maeser, so of Principal Karl G. Maeser, Rosa Lee from Beaver who became the wife of George Southerland one of the Supreme Judges of the United States Court, and Lessa Kimball and Maggie Christmas both of Salt Lake City.  Part of the time I roomed with J. Golden Kimball's mother who lived in another part of the house. There were several boys boarded there also. Golden was the senior over the house. We all had to be in the dining room at a certain time of the morning for prayers.  Several times some of us girls would not get in there in time for prayers and Golden would always report us to Professor Maeser. We would be called onto the carpet, but he was very kind to us and would say, \u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d Those were very happy days for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter returning home from school, Mother, Father and I made a visit to my sister Melissa Lee\u2019s in Panaca, Nevada. After we came home, my niece Lydia Osborn was marred to M.C. Morris of Salt Lake. Wallace Hamblin, my boy friend or beau as we then called them, returned home from a trip to Wyoming where he had been assisting in driving some cattle to the market in Cheyenne. My brother Watson and Harriet Eyre were preparing to get married in December so we decided to accompany them and make it a double affair. My brother obtained a white top buggy and Wallace a light spring wagon and we set off for St. George on Sunday morning. It took us three days to get there. We were married in the St. George Temple Wednesday the 14th of December 1881. We stayed over on Thursday and took in the sights of the city.\n</p>\n<p>\nA very strange thing happened to us while in St. George. The man where we stopped, a Brother Hall, wanted us to take a 60 gallon barrel of wine to Milford to ship North to his son. It was decided that we take it as we had a wagon. We had not traveled very far until a boy came riding up and said something was spilling out of our wagon. On investigating we found some of the hoops had broken off the barrel so we tipped it on the other end and we went on and pretty soon the hoops broke off that end. Then we turned the barrel on its side thinking we could save some that way, but the staves broke in the center and it all leaked out, and all our bedding was soaked with wine. We tried in all the settlements to obtain a barrel or keg, but could not get one. Brother Hall was very angry about it and wanted us to pay for it. We could not help it, and of course we did not pay for it.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe arrived home on Sunday just as church was dismissed and they gave us cheers of welcome was we passed by them. Our parents had a fine reception for us after our return. On the 28th of December, Wallace was best man and I was bride\u2019s maid to a very dear girl friend, Jane Stoddard, and Tine Brigham, a cousin of mine. We had very gay times in our early wedded life. It being the winter holidays, there was a dance or some kind of amusements going on every night, and in those days they would last until the wee small hours of the morning.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy brother Watson and wife and Wallace and I all lived at home with my parents.  The men folk spent the winter freighting and hauling ore from the Lincoln Mines to Milford. The following spring, March 28, 1882, Wallace\u2019s twin brother William and Mrs.  Rosa Wood were married in the St. George Temple. In the spring and summer the men spent their time farming.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe following September 7th, Watson's wife presented him with a fine son, Watson Loraine Rollins \u2014 Grandparents and all just idealized him. As for myself, I thought I could not possibly think any more of a baby than I did of him, until the following December 12, 1882. We were happy parents of a fine son, Wallace Eugene. Naturally he was the nicest baby ever born. The two boys grew up together and as far as affection goes I think two brothers could not have loved one another more than they did.  After our babies came, my brother and his wife moved to a place of their own and Wallace and I remained with my parents.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn May after we were married, I accompanied my parents to St. George Temple and assisted them in doing work for their kindred dead. While there, Sister Lucy B.  Young had my Aunt Mary Lightner, my mother and I accompany her to a room several stories up which had an altar in it. She then gave each one of us a blessing in tongues and then she interpreted them. One thing she said in my blessing was that I should have a son and that he would go to the nations of the earth and preach the Gospel (which was fulfilled). When Eugene was 21 years old, he and Lorraine both went on missions in the same year and returned the same year. Both fulfilling honorable missions.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe years went on and we were struggling to make a living and trying at the same time to build us a home. During the summer of 1884, Wallace and Henry Hall of Minersville made a kiln of brick to burn them. While he was thus employed, we were again presented with another fine son. On the 3rd of December 1884, Claudious Lee was born. We were trying to keep one of the first commandments to multiply and replenish the earth. I thought that was our mission here. There was no race suicide in those days especially with the Mormon people.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next summer we had a two-room brick home put up on a lot, with an apple and pear orchard on it, in the center of town. We had bought the lot of Wallace\u2019s Uncle George Marshall. We did not get our house finished until January 1887. We still lived with my parents. On the 19th of January, the stork brought us another son, Edwin Rollin. Our home had just been plastered and as soon as we thought it was dry enough, we moved into it with our three children.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe enjoyed being to ourselves very much, although it was hard for me to leave Father and Mother to do for themselves. They were getting along in years and were not able to do everything for themselves. But we were only two short blocks away and we would help them with their hardest work. When the boys were large enough to assist them with their chores, one of them stayed there and helped them all they could.\n</p>\n<p>\nTime went on and my husband\u2019s mother, Mary Ann Hamblin, moved to Salt Lake with her two daughters, Effie and Essie Stoddard. She took up obstetrics and became a very efficient doctor and nurse. This was during a building boom in Salt Lake, and as work around home in Minersville was very scarce, she sent for Wallace and his brother William to come up there to Salt Lake with their teams to work. They took their families with them. They obtained work hauling rock and building material.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe, both families, lived together until the fall of 1890. Just before the October Conference of the LDS Church, we decided we would try and get a house or an apartment and move to ourselves. We set out house-hunting and when we would see a house for rent, we would inquire about it. Invariably they would ask, \u201cHave you any children?\u201d \u201cYes, we have three small sons.\u201d Their answer would be, \u201cNo! We can't rent to anyone with children.\u201d Very discouraged I went up to Wallace\u2019s mother and told her of our trouble in trying to get a house. In a joking way I said, \u201cWell, 'll go home where I can have all the children we want and nobody will bother us.\u201d We were expecting the stork to again visit us.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy parents came up to Salt Lake to attend conference and I returned home with them. Wallace stayed in Salt Lake to work. One day early in February, I was returning home from Mother\u2019s with Rollin a hold of my hand. As we were passing our corral, a cow that had just been brought up off the range with a young calf took after us. We just escaped her horns by crawling through some bars close by.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next morning I was quite sick. My sister Birdie was staying with me. She was a child about 12. I called her and sent for my mother and Aunt Dee who was a mid-wife.  I got some better but continued being ill for three days. On the 6th of February 1891 I gave birth to twin girls. They were very tiny and no one had any idea they would live.  We put them both on the scales together and they just weighed 7 lbs. My husband was still in Salt Lake. My brother Watson and his wife were all with me when I was in trouble.  He went for the Elders and brought them to bless and name the babies. We all thought they would die because they groaned every breath they drew. We gave them the names of Ida Melissa and Addie Manerva.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were so small and delicate and quite a care for a long time. My husband being away made it quite hard for me to care for them in my weakened condition. But my dear old mother would come up every day and do all she could to help me and would stay with me until the babies would quiet down for the night. Mother would help me with them until they got so they were better and easier to take care of. After the babies were five months old, they seemed to thrive and grow from then on. By the way, when they were born I did not have anything to put on them as they were too small to dress. So they were just wrapped in cotton and a shawl until we were able to get some clothes made for them. Their father did not see them until they were three months old. When he returned home from Salt Lake he had been working for a furniture man and brought home two high chairs and a baby bug%y and a nice rocking chair for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the twins, came our 4th son, William Clark born on the 20th of September 1893. In three more years our 5th son, Henry Marcene, was born on the 18th of November 1896.  These children, seven of them, were all born in Minersville, Utah.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had five boys and we began to think about their future. There were no facilities or opportunities there for them to branch out. We had only a few acres of land besides our city lot. There was nothing for them to do when they got older, or land to get houses for themselves. There was no room in Southern Utah for the fast multiplying generation to grow into, so Wallace\u2019s Uncle Ephraim Marshall and a friend, William McKnight, went up in the northern part of Utah to a place called Lucerne Valley, trying to find a place for their fast growing families.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey returned with glowing reports of the country and several of the married men with large families took their word for it and were very much enthused about the story.  Several of them sold their homes and prepared to move to this new place where there was plenty of land and water. A company was formed and on the 7th of September 1897 about 2 p.m. they made a start \u2014 for they thought to better their conditions financially.  This company was all composed of sons and daughters of the early pioneers of Utah.  The company was composed of Ephraim Marshall, his wife and family, James Watson Rollins, his wife and family, Charles L. Rollins, his wife and family, William Hollinshead, his wife and child, William McKnight, his wife and family, Clarence Rollins and his wife, and John Corbridge making a total of 35 souls. The party had 11 wagons, 3 buggies, 30 work horses, 140 head of cattle and some loose animals.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe day of their leaving was a very eventful one in the history of their lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen they left, sad indeed was the parting, for probably years would pass before many of them would meet again and some of them never. The pioneers were given a fine farewell party in the Minersville Chapel. Fond farewells were taken of their loved ones.  Groups of friends on street corners said goodbye and wished them success and God speed on their way. The Bishop of the Ward George Eyre, escorted them for several miles out of the town promptly at 2 p.m. They turned their faces Northward to what they thought would be a new and better home.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey camped the first night near Beaver. Camping was quite a novelty to some for them, especially the young ones. By the time the travelers reached Fillmore, in Millard County, they were joined by John Henry Blackner and wife and family. This enlarged the company by eleven souls, 2 wagons, several horses and 18 head of cattle.\n</p>\n<p>\nWallace and I were preparing to go with the company, but we did not get our affairs settled in time to leave with them. We sold our home and what land we had in the field. We gathered up our belongings and just a week after the company left, we started out on the 13th of September 1897. There were 9 souls of us, 3 wagons, 7 horses, 2 cows and a dozen chickens. We joined the other company at Mona, Utah making 10 families with 52 souls in company.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe little band of emigrants struggled along, part of the way made difficult by the sickness of some of its members. My brother Charles\u2019 family, all but three were very sick with Mountain Fever. During the entire trip of five weeks, some of the family were very sick. In the evening, at the bedside of some of the sick, prayers were offered up for the afflicted and the sincere supplications were heard and answered. We passed through many trying experiences, but the march continued on, all striving to make the best of what came. We had one of our wagon boxes built as a sheep wagon with a bed and stove which made it very convenient for the family to eat and sleep. We with four of the smaller children slept in the wagon. The three older boys had to make their beds on the ground. The other two wagons were driven by Lee and Rollin \u2014 one 12 and the other 10 years old. Eugene, riding a saddle horse, helped to drive the cattle and loose horses.  We had traveled through stormy weather since leaving Heber City, which made it very disagreeable especially for those that had to make their beds on the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn the 15th of October we drove into the far famed Lucerne Valley which is now called Manila. Here we met my husband's brother William and his wife and family and Nathanial Goodman and his son William. These people had preceded the band in May that same year. My brother Watson and family and us with our family made our camp at his brother William\u2019s place. He had a large sawed log house partially completed. Others of the company camped at a place called Birch Springs. We were very much disappointed with the surroundings \u2014 it not being as represented. I think we women folk were more disappointed than the men.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey all got busy and staked off some land and then they prepared and went to the mountains to cut logs to build houses with as winter was coming on. They did not seem very enthused over the prospects as some real estate men from Ogden had the water question in hand and they wanted $1,600 for a water right for 160 acres. After the men folk arrived in the timber, they talked over the situation. They decided to leave the women and families there and go and see if they could find a more suitable place to locate.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey went to Ft. Bridger. When they arrived at Bridger Valley, a Mr. Sam Strong told them about the Carter Canal and a lot of land on the \u201clower bench\u201d which was vacant. Without going any further they bought the Carter canal for the sum of $1,500 and each one of them located, staked off 160 acres of land, and filed on it while there.  They borrowed the money to file from Mr. Joseph Guild who was a merchant at Ft.  Bridger. They had left their money with their wives and just taken enough for traveling expenses. Wallace filed on a place 3 % miles northeast of Lyman located on the Blacks Fork River. They were gone just a week when they returned and told us women what they did. We soon packed up and moved right over. We were just a week coming over from Lucerne Valley to Bridger Valley. There was a big snow storm that came on us enroute. We arrived at Mt. View on the 8th of November in a terrible blizzard. We stopped at the first place we came to which was Wallace Stevens\u2019 ranch. They had all of the boys that had been sleeping out come in the house and make their beds on the floor. We never forgot the kind hospitality Mr. Stevens and wife showed us.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next day we all found houses to live in at Mt. View. My brother Watson and our family rented a small two-room house and each family had a room a piece with no door between us. We put our sewing machines against the door for a partition but the children would climb over them. We managed fairly well with our sheep wagons for the boys to sleep in.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe children that were old enough went to school in Mt. View. Their teacher was a Miss Estella Sullen from Fort Bridger. As soon as we were located for the winter, the men folk got ready and went to the mountains to get out logs for their houses and out buildings. They had the houses partly done by the forepart of March 1898. We moved into our two-room Io% house before it was chinked or daubed with a dirt roof and dirt floor. This was the 9th of March and there was a terrible blizzard on.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a small branch of the LDS Church here, presided over by Samuel R.  Brough. They had Sunday School in Brother Joseph Wall's house which was only partly completed. Brother Henry Voss was superintendent. It was a branch of the Summitt Stake of the LDS Church. When our company came, it swelled the membership quite considerable in numbers. We used to bring our family and drive over from Mt. View to attend Sunday School. Very soon the authorities of the church came out and organized us into a ward with 8.R. Brough as Bishop, Ephraim Marshall, one of our company, as first counselor and Augustus Youngberg as second counselor.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had quite a hard struggle clearing our land of sage brush and getting it fenced. All hands would have to work making ditches and plowing the land. They got a few acres of wheat and oats in and some potatoes. They also put in several acres of Lucerne. They bought the lucerne seed on the road out here.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhenever the men could get a job working out, they would do so to get money to buy feed for their teams. Rollin, who was 11 years old after we came, hired out to Joseph Strong for 8 dollars per month. He obtained enough money to get him a suit of clothes and other things to attend school with. Lee hired out as a sheep camp tender.  Eugene and Lee both worked for a Mr. Marchasault. They managed to attend school in the winter. We had been married 15 years when we moved to Wyoming.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter my brothers Charles, Watson and myself moved here and left our parents in Minersville, they were not contented. They sold their home and came to cast their lot with their children. They arrived here on the 8th of July 1898 and made their home with me. Father's health had been very poor for several years and this climate was very severe on him. He was suffering with Brights Disease and he passed away on the 7th of February 1899 \u2014 just living seven months after he came. He was the first man buried in the Lyman Cemetery. Father would have been 83 years old the following May 27.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy husband\u2019s mother came up to Wyoming that same winter after we came.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe came as Doctor and Nurse for Mrs. Ida Marshall and Mrs. Hannah Blackner and she brought them both fine sons, John Marshall and Bernard Blackner. Grandma Hamlin while here, filed on 160 acres of land just below the Lyman dugway and sent for her son-in-law Lue Pope and daughter Effie to come up. They lived in a one-room log house that she had built on her farm and they farmed the place.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy father and mother would go and stay for a week or so at a time with each one of my brothers but would soon get homesick and want to came back to my place where their bed and things were.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat fall after they came, there was quite a snow storm. My son Lee took his rifle and went over the ridge from our place and shot an antelope. He was only 13 years old.  He tried to lift the antelope on his horse but could not, so he came home for help. When he told father he had killed an antelope, he doubted it until Lee showed him some blood and hair that he had got on him trying to lift it on his horse. Father was as excited about it as Lee was. They took a small sleigh and tied a rope around the horn of a saddle.  Rollin went out with to help bring it in and then Father showed the boys how to skin and dress the antelope. We certainly enjoyed this meat and sent all our neighbors a fry.  This was the fall of 1898.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt Christmas time, the Sunday School had a program and a Christmas tree held in Ephraim Marshall\u2019s new house. In January, Father and Mother went to my brother Watson\u2019s to visit for a week or so. While there, Father took quite sick so they came home to my place. He did not get down helpless in bed but would only lie down at intervals. He failed very fast and he passed away while sitting in his chair at 5 p.m. on the 7th of February 1899. Just the day before Father died was my twin girls 8th birthday.  Lee had just got him a violin and was trying to play it while the girls were singing and dancing and having a great time. Father got up out of his chair and leaned on the door and watched the children play. He enjoyed them very much and would sit an evening and tell them stories of his hunting trips while crossing the plains and to California.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 1899 we sent Eugene down to Salt Lake to school. He was staying with my sister Mary Osborn. He was getting along fine in school when he contracted a cold and had a very severe spell of bronchitis. So as soon as he was able, she sent him home as she was not able to take care of him. We sent Rollin to Carter Station in the night after him, as he was the only one home.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy husband and Lee were away working on the railroad at Spring Valley. Before he left he brought his mother down to stay with me as we were expecting the stork that afternoon. I had a terrible hemorrhage and gave birth to a fine baby boy, but it never lived. My life was dispared of and only through faith and prayer and power of the priesthood through the Elders, Bishop Brough and Ephraim Marshall, was my life spared. This was the 22nd of November 1899 \u2014 the same night that Eugene came home sick. I was a long time gaining my strength and before getting around, I had a severe spell of pleurisy.\n</p>\n<p>\nTime went on and we kept on improving our farm and every year getting a little more land under cultivation and fenced. But the men folk would have to go away from home and work whenever they would get a chance. In the year 1901, Cumberland coal mines had just opened up and there was a lot of work over there. Eugene and Lee went over and obtained work. Along in the summer I decided I would go over and cook for the boys. I was not very well and would consult the Doctor there about myself, as there was no doctor here at that time. When the crops were all gathered and taken care of, my husband came over to Cumberland and obtained work in N.2 south mine.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout the middle of September I took sick with another terrible hemorrhage and as I was expecting the stork again about the first of December, I was frightened very bad. My husband was over to Lyman. I aroused Eugene and had him go across the street and get Erastus Hollingshead to go to No.1 Cumberland for the Doctor. He had a team there, so he got the doctor and gave me some medicine and told me to stay in bed until I was better. I did so for several days and I would feel alright then. As soon as I would get on my feet and try to do anything I would start to hemorrhage again so I lingered on that way for three weeks and on the 7th of October my baby came. He was premature and was very small and delicate. He was a fine boy \u2014 if he had been much finer we could not have found him. Lee came in and saw him all done up in a small bundle and says, \u201cHello, Bobby\u201d and that is how he got the name of Bob. I was confined to my bed from then on until the middle of December. We still lived in Cumberland until the next Spring, when we moved back to the farm.\n</p>\n<p>\nEugene was called in September 1802 with Loraine Rollins, Thomas J. Brough and Jay Marshall to go to B.Y. Minerscity and take a missionary course. Then in April 1903 he was called on a mission for the LDS Church to what was then the Colorado Mission. We only had two weeks to prepare him for this mission. He left Salt Lake on the 22th of April. He filled a very honorable mission. Sometimes we did not know where we were going to get money to keep him on but somehow by scheming and working it came. Lee and Rollin worked out most of the time and helped to keep him, and Wallace, his father, would take care of the farm. Then to help out, every week I would take a team and buggy and go around the Valley and gather up butter, eggs and vegetables and go to Spring Valley and Cumberland and peddle them. So with all of us working, we managed to keep him. He was released and returned on the 23 of July 1905.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe went to Salt Lake and obtained work as a street car conductor and afterwards worked for the S.L. Hardware and Implyment Co. He worked for them for several years.\n</p>\n<p>\nRollin, my 3th son, was called to go to Paris, Idaho to take a missionary course.  He was called to go the Australia. He left for this mission the 19th of October 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 1909 Lee leased a hotel in Elko, Wyoming, a coal mining camp near Kemmerer. He wanted the girls to go and run it for him but I would not let them go unless I went with them. We rented our farm and moved over there and kept boarders for the Company. We had as high as 60 boarders at the time. There is where Lee met Miss Mary Easton. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple on the 11% of November 1909. While there we were able to send money to Rollin on his mission. Wallace worked in the boiler house.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had a ward of the Church there with Wallace Cragon as Bishop. I was put in as Relief Society President and Lee was put in as Y.M.M.A President. I had my Counselors, Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Christenson. I remained president until we moved home in the spring of 1910.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter moving back home to Lyman, the girls went to Salt Lake to obtain work to help keep their brother Rollin on his mission. They got work in the Troy Laundry and their brother Eugene was working for the Consolidated Wagon and Machine Co. so they rented apartments and cooked for him. They worked there until Rollin returned from his mission.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll this time, Addie was corresponding with Levi Blad of Panaca, Nevada, who went to Australia on a mission at the same time as Rollin and returned at the same time.  They came home in February 1911 and Addie and Levi were married the following November 15th in the Salt Lake Temple. After having a reception here at home they went to Panaca, Nevada to make their home.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Addie left and separated from her sister Ida, it was one of the hardest things I had to put up with in life. Within the next seven or eight months, three more of my children were married. Eugene met and married Miss Pauline Zabriskie on April 9th 1912. Rollin married Miss Cora Roberts on the 28th of February 1912. Ida married Eugene Eyre on the 5th of June 1912, so that left our home kind of desolate. My mother was still living with me.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the summer I made a trip to Panace, Nevada to visit my daughter and sister Melissa Lee. While there I was called home on account of the illness of my mother. My sister Melissa from Panaca also came home with me and my sister Mary Osborn from Salt Lake was called. We found mother very bad and she passed away on the 25th of September 1912. She was buried by the side of father in the Lyman Cemetery. Mother\u2019s children were all at her bedside at her passing. Mary, Melissa, Charles, Watson and myself. She was then in her 90th year.\n</p>\n<p>\nAddie remained home that winter as she was expecting the stork. She was presented with a fine baby girl, Phyllis, on the 29th of November 1912. On the following December 7%, Rollin\u2019s wife presented him with a fine son, Edwin Wallace. Rollin lives on a farm in Milburn. He has lived there since 1918. He has a family of seven children, five boys and two girls. Two are married and each have two little girls to bless their homes.  Lee has a family of three, two girls and one boy. A girl Lela died of Diphtheria at the age of 10. Eugene has one boy.\n</p>\n<p>\nEugene came to Lyman to live and kept the post office and a small confectionary.  He has always from infancy been afflicted with bronchitis. When the terrible plague of the Spanish Flu came along he contracted it and pneumonia set in. He passed away on the 16th of October 1918.\n</p>\n<p>\nPauline and their son Robert were very sick at the same time and was not able to attend the funeral. My husband and son Robert and Lucille were all down with the flu and Robert had pneumonia. They were all very bad. These were very trying times for me. I was just recovering from the flu myself. Eugene\u2019s son, Robert, died four years later on June 22, 1923, with diphtheria in Salt Lake City.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the year 1916, the United States became involved in trouble with Mexico and our son, Marcene, enlisted in the National Guard June or July 5th He with three other boys went to Cheyenne and from there to the Mexican border and served there until March 1917. He returned home March 10th and went to Cumberland and obtained work in the mines there. He only worked a few shifts when he was called back to World War I in April. He helped guard the Aspen tunnel, then was called to go to Kemmerer and train men for the war. He went from Cheyenne then to Camp Dix, North Carolina. While there he was taken sick and went to the hospital. He had two quarts of water drawn off his lungs. He went to Camp Mills, New York. After being there for several months, the company embarked for France. While off the coast of Ireland, their ship was torpedoed by a German submarine but it missed its mark about 50 feet. The United States ship turned their guns on it and it went down. Their ship landed at Belgrade, France between Christmas and New Year's Eve. We received a telegram from the Red Cross on New Year's Eve that their ship had landed safely, which was a great relief to us all. Marcene remained in France until March 1919, when he was mustered out and returned home on the 11th of March. Through prayers and supplications he never had to face the firing line, but was kept very busy hauling supplies and training men with the gas masks. Our son, Eugene, passed away during Marcene\u2019s absence.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next year, on September 25, 1920, Marcene married Miss Duella Eyre.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom this union there are four children, two boys and two girls \u2014 Ivan, Geraldine, Dale and Darlene. They are living in Murray, Utah.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 1922, due to a strike in the mines in Cumberland, Lee, Clark and Marcene all came home. We let Lee have our farm and Clark stayed there and helped that summer.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat fall on November 1%, my husband obtained work in the Union Pacific shops in Green River. Clark went to Reliance, Wyoming, and obtained work in the mines there.  Marcene went to Salt Lake and then to Murray, Utah. I stayed in Lyman that winter with Robert and Lucille in school. In May, 1923 we moved to Green River and Robert worked for the Union Pacific and Lucille was working for the Union Telegraph Co.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile working in Green River, we bought a two-room house and a lot in Lyman.  On December 14, 1931, Wallace and I were married 50 years and our children got together and planned a celebration. They gave us a lovely Golden Wedding reception at the high school. They served a lovely dinner and presented us with a beautiful over- stuffed set of chairs. All our children and grandchildren and two great grandchildren were present. Our son Eugene and three grandchildren had passed away. We had a very pleasant time meeting so many relatives and friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe lived in Green River nearly 10 years. My husband was laid off on his birthday when he was 70 years old. The Union Pacific gave us a pass on the railroad to the Western States and the Pacific Coast. We started out from Green River on the 4 of May and went on the O.S. line to Murtah, Idaho, where we visited an old neighbor, William Goodman and family. We went from there to La Grande, Oregon, and visited a grand niece, Wanda Mathews Zanejg and then went to San Francisco, California and visited my niece, Daisy Rollins Hollingshead and family at San Leandro. Then we visited another neighbor, Mrs. Cora Shurtz at Santa Cruz, California. She took us all around.  We went to the big giant redwood forest and on to the coast where we gathered sea shells and watched the tide come in. We had a very pleasant time while there.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe went from there to Burbank, California, where my sister Addie Rollins Colton lives and visited with her and family for ten days. We went to Long Beach and saw two of my nieces, Mrs. Neva Osborn Davie and her sister Hattie Kennedy and their families and grand nephew, Clarence Grenig and wife and family, also his father, Dan Grenig.  We also saw a girl pal of mine, Jane Bingham. We went to Los Angeles and saw a niece and nephew, Linda Rollins Scott and Guy Rollins.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe took the train from there and visited San Bernardino where my parents lived from 1851 until 1858. We were shown the pioneer house and where my father's dwelling was and also his store where there is a very large post office built there now.  We started from there on the S.L. and Los Angeles line. Our next stop was at Las Vegas, Nevada. We visited our daughter Lucille at the Blue Diamond Mine where her husband, Earl Long, was teaching school. We went to the Boulder Dam which was under construction. From there we went to visit our daughter Addie Hamblin Blad and family. While there I was quite sick, also Lucille who accompanied us there. My husband had the hay fever quite bad and was anxious to get home. This was the 1% of July 1932 and it was the last time I saw Addie alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe went from there to Minersville, our former home town, and spent the 4th of July there. I had a sister and brother living there and a great many relatives and enjoyed visiting them very much. We journeyed on to Salt Lake and Murray where our son, Marcene, and family live. We stayed there for a few days and arrived home in Lyman on the 13th of July 1932, having been over two months on our trip which we enjoyed very much.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe moved in our two-room house and enjoyed it very much. During this year I had a very bad foot with varicose ulcers and was not able to be on my feet very much.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn February, Addie took very sick with what we thought was the flu. Her trouble seemed to be all in her back. She got better for a while, but at intervals would be very bad so they decided that she must go to St. George. They took her to Dr. McGreager and he took and x-ray of her and found that she had a stone in one of her kidneys. But her heart was so bad that she was not able to have an operation at that time so she returned home. In May she returned for an operation. While on the operating table they took a stone out of her kidney 2 1/2 inches long and then they decided to take out her kidney as it had started to decay. She passed away on the operating table on the 12th of May and was buried in Panaca, Nevada on the 14th of May. Surviving her was her husband, Levin Blad, and eight children, her parents and five brothers and two sisters who all attended her funeral.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat same year after Addie\u2019s death, Lucille came home to stay with me as she was expecting the stork. But she was in such a condition we took her to Rock Springs Hospital and she gave birth to a baby boy, Demar. She had two older children, Vella and Donnie. As soon as she was able, she worked in the Ideal Caf\u00e9 for Ida. At present Ida has a maternity home and has taken care of a great many cases. We were living in our little home very comfortable when my husband\u2019s health began to fail. We did everything we could for him and took him to Salt Lake thinking the change of climate might do him good. But it was too late. We returned home on the 30th of September and he passed away that evening at 7 O\u2019clock while sitting in his chair. He had enlargement of the heart. His children were all to his funeral but Lucille and she was in Washington State and would not get here in time. I have lived alone since then but several of my children live close around. This is February 1939. I have five sons and two daughters living, one son and one daughter dead, 38 grandchildren living and 4 dead, 14 great grandchildren.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy Church Activities\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the Primary Association was first organized in Minersville, I was chosen second counselor to Mary Ann Hamblin when I was 18 years old. After I was married and had three children, I was put in President of the Y.L.M.L.A. in Minersville. I acted in that capacity for several years. Then I was Relief Society teacher there. In 1892 was chosen secretary for the Relief Society of the Minersville Ward and secretary for the Relief Society of the Minersville Ward and held that office for five years. I was Relief Society teacher for several years in Lyman, Wyoming. We moved to Elko and I was put in as Relief Society President. I acted there until we moved home and then was chosen Stake Secretary in 1919 and held that office until Addie Brough the Stake President moved to Salt Lake. I was Ward Secretary of Lyman for five years. When we moved to Green River in 1923 I acted as Ward Relief Society teacher there, then I was chosen as second counselor in the Relief Society to Mrs. Ruth Manwaring. Later I was chosen as her first counselor, and still held that position in 1932 when we moved back to Lyman.  At the present time I am Captain of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers of the Bridger Valley Camp.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nALBERT EDWARD WOOLLEY CHISHOLM\n</p>\n<p>\nI was born in London, England on June 12, 1880, but my father brought us to America when I was seven years old and my sister, Florence was five. The only thing I remember about that trip by ship was when there was a big wave; and I went with the wave. I almost went over the edge, but the man who tended the hold of the ship grabbed me and said, \"Now will you stay down in the hold when I tell you?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe landed down South. I remember there were a lot of colored people where I was. Our father said, \u201cYou stay right here until I get back,\u201d but when he got back it was closed and everyone was gone.  We managed to stay put at the gate outside so he found us quite easily; but he was scared to death. They have quite a \"bull pen\" they herd you into and you stay there until they tell you to move.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe came on the train right to Salt Lake City, Utah (16th ward).  We lived with my father and his sister, Aunt Emily, for a while. My father was a stage manager and dyed clothes. I was about nine years old when he passed away. I continued to live with Aunt Emily, who had four children at that time. She had several more later, several boys I believe. My sister went to live with Aunt Lottie (Giles) in Provo. I went to school in 16th ward, but not too many years (8th grade education). I didn't like it. At age 13, I had typhoid fever and lost the hearing in my left ear. We moved around half a dozen times as I remember. Then finally 1 went to Provo and went to school there.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I was 13 or 14 I got my first job with a photograph gallery on West Temple and First South. I polished the pictures and also carried picture equipment up to take pictures of Angel Moroni on top of the temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne time I was sick and Aunt and Grandma didn't know I had something like walking pneumonia. Grandma took off my shoes and that's the last thing I remember for three months. Grandma gave me whiskey and nursed me back to health. Everyday I would just drink e whiskey and two doctors would come out to check me. When I was getting better I got in the Alfalfa field and sat in the sun. Grandma gave me some new clothes and shoes.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter going to school in Provo for a while, I returned to Salt Lake City. By that time, Aunt Em's was getting quite crowded so I got a job at a floral--Evans Floral--the wife was a grey-haired lady, and he was a grey-haired, very strict Englishman. He used to give me a dime and send me to do the deliveries. He said \"If the car (street car) comes you take it and if it doesn't come you walk.\" I would walk to save the dime and run to get there faster. I also helped to design wreaths, and earned $1.50 a week. They had coal- burning heaters for their greenhouses. Later they moved to Tenth East and Fourth South to a bigger floral there, then to Denver.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved back to Provo, where I lived with Aunt Lottie and went to public school at the old depot. Whenever I got a chance, I would draw. I would draw everything. My teacher would walk around the class, take my picture, go to the front of the class and say it was perfect. My favorite treat was Morrison Meat Pies with sauce. I used to be a fry cook at one of the restaurants there, too.\n</p>\n<p>\nA man by the name of Jepperson in Provo had a couple of sons- -1 used to go with those sons sometimes. They made guitars. This man was an artist--painted ships on curtains for when they came down in the Opera House. They let me watch them making guitars and I got interested in what they were doing.\n</p>\n<p>\nI quit Provo and moved back to Salt Lake City and started making violins. I read books and watched people and that's how I learned to make them. I lived on North Temple and Sixth West at that time with Aunt Em. Then she moved out toward Redwood Road.  They bought a lot there, and he bought some lumber and his sons put together and built a house. The built it all in one day just about.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen I went to work for a man named Dyer-- a very staunch church man. He let me run the greenhouse while he turned to other things, so I learned to tend the greenhouse rather well. I remember one time he told me to clean up the room so I cleaned the desk a put all the white, all the blue, all the pink paper together and the boss didn't want it because he couldn't find anything.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1908, I built the home I now live in and have always lived In since. (1759 Fourth East in Salt Lake City.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI learned how to play violin, clarinet, baritone trumpet, trombone, harmonica, and Auto harp. The first band I played with was the farmers Ward band for children. We played at different wards, poor people's homes and went to the old prison on 21st South.  Later I played in a band but didn't get paid so I started my own band.  This was the Chisholm Concert Band and we worked for the city playing in the park.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we were at Camp Slone, we had an orchestra. We used to go down the street and serenade; the people would feed us cake and.  things. This was Burt Rand, Charlie Walker, myself, and one or two.  others that would come and go all the time. We also used to play at Saltair. I learned to play by instruction books. I never had any lessons. We used to call Saltair Spiderville because there were so many spiders in the pavilion. They used to fall down the ladies\u2019 necks. My son Ralph used to go with me many a Sunday Afternoon. The bandleader was John Montgomery, and then I took over for eight years. This was in the \"Twenties\" or before--before the depression- -plenty of money and life was plenty good.\n</p>\n<p>\nI led the Post Office Band and in 1915 went to Los Angeles and San Francisco by train for the \"Federation Days\" held by the National Federation of Post Office Clerks. (The men were quite wayward.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI played at the dedication of the Capital Building with 145 people. After that, I went to the Mayor and said \"I won't be playing anymore because I'm going on the farm\". That was a bad decision.\n</p>\n<p>\nI did some plowing in Scipio when Ralph was eleven or twelve years old. Did it for seven years while I lived in a tent and just about broke even. I remember thinking how funny it was that down there when something was bad they said it was a piece of cheese instead of a piece of cake. I bought a tractor from Twin City (brand made in Minnesota). It had big metal wheels and I had a lot of it would only go on the road.) I plowed ant there in Scipio. I plowed 20 acres I mortgaged my home to buy the tractor, wasn't any good the mortgage stayed on.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was a cook for Knutsford Hotel until one of the cooks took a cleaver and struck the other cook with it so I left there. He hit him broadside against the face, but that was enough for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen I went to the Bismark on 30 West and Second South for years until 1916 when they passed the Prohibition Act. It was a Cafe and Bar where I was a cook and then a bartender until Prohibition closed the Bismark down. My boss there was Mr. Sigmund Simon, a German Jew and a very nice man. He had bartenders from all over the country that he would send for because he wanted good me to handle the bars. Later he opened a different place. My Sons, Harrold and Ralph, as children, used to go in the Bismark many times for their oyster crackers.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I left the Bismark, I took up a job setting up bowling pins downstairs from the Bismark. I was originally hired for that, but they found out I knew about cooking and soon I was in charge of all the cooking. In 1917 during the First World War, I worked as a time keeper on the Garfield-Bingham Railroad. I worked the Railroad for quite some time. I quit that and started my own cafe in 1922 on first South.\n</p>\n<p>\nI met my wife, Lovina Fitzgerald, in Provo when I was 19. She was coming around the block, and I saw this woman coming around so I went around the other way because I didn't want to meet her.  Then her sister wanted me to come and meet her at her home, so I brushed up and went out to her home. Lovina lived in Draper but was staying with her Sister Delia Fitzgerald Bonnett in Provo. Her mother was working at the insane asylum and I was carrying the food around. Her husband, Jack Bonnett, worked in a silver mine up Provo Canyon. When we returned to Salt Lake City, I would ride a bicycle from town to her home in Draper--3/4 hour on cow trails. I married Lovina at the City and County Building when she was 27 and I was 23. (Sept. 30, 1903) Laura, Clo, and Grandma went with us.  We were later sealed in the Salt Lake Temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne time I worked as a cook up Provo Canyon for the crew who were working on the power plant. Two fellows were the ones who started electrical energy from water in this area. They started Telluride Power Company. There still is an outfit in Colorado that carries the Telluride name, but at the time it was all through southern Utah. They had this hydroplant in Provo and I cooked for their crew. I was probably under 20 at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter they were through, I was persuaded by some guy to go over into Colorado and sell clothing. I sold suits up in Silverton, Colorado, and through that area and made more money that I had in my whole life.\n</p>\n<p>\nI've been driving a car since 1913 when I had a Model T Ford-- with straight fenders, brass radiator, window curtains, and fold- down top. When it didn't run right you would fiddle with the colls in front. The coils intensified the spark. To start it it had a crank. I remember once my son, Harrold, pushed down on the crank instead of pulling up and broke his arm. It barely got healed before he did the same thing and broke it again. I then had a Dodge, and then an old black ford--I remember I had trouble with the radiator so took it into a place to have it soldered. They soldered it up so there was no return. I got about a block away and it blew up--like a steam engine.  I never had a new car.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow I have a red, '53 Ford. What gets my goat is that my next- door neighbor, when I ran into their house by mistake and scraped a little paint off, had me arrested. The policeman came, and I told him 1 did it. He told me I would have to take some driving instructions.  The man didn't give me any instructions, just drove me around and said I should take my car home and leave it there. Then I got a letter saying I was prohibited from driving.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked in toys, lamps, and ran the stock room at ZCMI for about 25 years from about the beginning of Second World War. I worked as custodian at night for them before I went into the stock room. I retired in 1960 at age 80, I now get retirement from them.  ($25 per month).\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had four children--Harrold, Ralph, Lois, and Vera--of which only Ralph and Vera are now living. Lois died at age 43 from cancer; and Harrold suffocated when he fell into a storage bin of insulation where he worked, one year just before Christmas.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs of this date, I have 13 grandchildren, 53 great grand- children, and 6 great, great grandchildren.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

They lived not far from the Doty family. He married the oldest daughter, Eliza. Austin and Eliza operated a prosperous farm. Austin tapped trees on his land to make maple syrup. Austin was a tall man; his wife could stand under his outstretched arm. Eliza was small in stature and had auburn hair; she was described as having a \"sweet, saintly face\" that denoted a strong character.\n</p>\n<p>\nAustin and Eliza joined the church in the spring of 1844. They sold their farm and moved to Nauvoo. Austin was assigned to help drain the swampland to make it useful to the settlers. He became ill with the malaria that was prevalent in early Nauvoo and died there, leaving Eliza with four young children.\n</p>\n<p>\nEliza was a descendant of Edward and Faith Clarke Dotey, who had sailed to America on the Mayflower, When her husband died, she was counseled by Apostle Kimball to marry again since she and her family would need help in the move West. She married her cousin William Murray, becoming his second wife in plural marriage. He confiscated her property and sold it to provide for his own family to go West. He left Eliza and her children to find their own way. (William Murray died on the trek west.)\n</p>\n<p>\nApril 30, 1848, Eliza married Alfred Brown, a widower with two small children. They remained at Council Bluffs, where Eliza gave birth to a son. They joined the wagon train of \"Warren Foote's Hundred,\" in', Kanesville, Iowa. Along the trail, Alfred died from cholera, and two days later her 17-year-old son also died. This left Eliza with three daughters, her new baby, and the son and daughter of Alfred by his first wife. Eliza was now 42 years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer family begged her to return to the east but she refused and pursued her way westward. She and her daughters yoked and hitched up the oxen and drove the team. She had a yoke of cows which not only helped pull the load but gave milk for the family. \n</p>\n<p>\nHeber C. Kimball, hearing of Alfred Brown's death, and realizing the difficulties she faced, sent word to have her drive into his yard when she reached Salt Lake, which she did September 17, 1850. Eliza married Heber for time only and lived in one of his houses until his death in 1866. Her daughter Laura later commented on the great love and respect they had for this good man. After Heber's death, Eliza spent her time in the homes of her three daughters. She was said to be \"an incessant toiler for the benefit of her family and friends, helpful and considerate of others, self-sacrificing, without enemies, faithful and true in all things and strong in her faith. \" (See source material.) She died at Laura's home in Kamas and was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nBiographical Notes: Mary Easton<br />\nby Robert L. Hamblin and Lorene Bradshaw\n</p>\n<p>\nMary Easton was born 14 January 1884, in Almy, Wyoming, a mining town just west and north two or three miles from Evanston off the highway to Randolf. Mary was the oldest daughter and second child of William Easton and Margaret Hood. William was the Mining Inspector at the mine, 50 she would have been considered one of the rich kids. Only the Mine Superintendent made more money than William.\n</p>\n<p>\nMary grew up in a home that valued education, reading, singing, organ music, and living in a nice, well-furnished home. William was a convert to the L.D.S. Faith , but Margaret was baptized some time after her parents and grandparents joined the Church. William\u00aes mother joined the Church, but he took the lead in his family\u2019s joining the Church and moving to the U.S., whereas Margaret Hood was the ninth child in her family of thirteen. Both her parents and grandparents joined the Church in Scotland, immigrated to the U.S., and died here.\n</p>\n<p>\nMomma was very close to both of her parents. According to Lorene, until he died, her father referred to Momma as his angel daughter, because she was so well-behaved, so kind and helpful to everyone. However, she identified closely with her mother and, therefore, became a good cook, a good baker, and a very good housekeeper. Lorene: \u201cMomma was also Grandma Easton\u2019s confidant, until she passed away at age 53 years,\u201d on 24 June, 1924,\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough her father and mother\u2019s obvious favorite of nine children, Mary was well liked, close to all of her brothers and sisters. Lorene and I never heard anything but praise and admiration of our mother from any of our Aunts and Uncles. They loved her dearly, which was easy. She was very kind and generous to everyone, and not at all abrasive.\n</p>\n<p>\nMining camps were rather impoverished communities, company towns, that only provided an elementary education for the children. Hence, Mary did not have the opportunity to go to high school, which she later regretted. However, she was a very bright student who excelled in her studies through the eighth grade. Her handwritten letters were written beautifully, grammatically, with correctly spelled words. When hand-writing letters, she wrote correctly the first time without crossing anything out. I admired that virtue, in part because I have never acquired it. Lorene told me several times that Mom\u2019s family had an organ, and that they sang a lot to organ music. That being the case, one might surmise that Mary would have become a talented organist and singer. She did sing very well but never learned how to play an organ or a piano, in fact any musical instrument. My parents sang together, and we sang to tunes played on a piano in our home. But it was a player piano, with pre-recorded tunes on roles of paper. When a role was placed into the piano and we pumped a lever, the keys played the recorded tune. Lorene completed three years of piano lessons and was the only one in our family who learned to play. None of Mom\u2019s brothers and sisters learned to play the organ, so I assume it was also a player organ.\n</p>\n<p>\nLee and Mary were married in the Salt Lake Temple on 9 November, 1909. He was almost 26 years old and she was almost 18. Dad had worked in the mine in Glencoe, near Kemmerer, where Mary lived with her family. They met each other at Church. To earn extra money Dad also played a snare drum or a Katar in a dance band. Lorene reported that Mom and Dad loved to go dancing, so other than visiting her at her home or going on walks, that is likely how he courted her.\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene said that Momma and Papa were popular with people where ever they lived. They always went dancing, to parties, and on mountain outings.\n</p>\n<p>\nMomma\u2019s Clothes\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene: \u201cWhen Momma married Papa, grandpa Easton bought her a big trunk-full of very beautiful clothes, more than any of her sisters ever had.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene reported that it was quite an experience to watch her put on her clothes. First, \u201cshe wore her L.D.S. garments, with long sleeves and legs to cover her wrists and ankles.\u201d The neck was trimmed with a little flat collar,\u201d a detail that Lorene apparently liked. \u201cThen Momma wore a corset that Papa usually helped her put on. It was made to fit from her hips to her busts. When she got into it, Papa or one of her sisters helped her lace it up. Then Papa would put his knee on her hip and pull it together until she could hardly breath. Finally, he tied the strings securely. Momma next put on a corset cover, a fancy lace and ruffled affair, followed by a fancy chemise that covered her busts.  After that she put on two or three fancy petticoats. Then she put on a shirt with a high neck and long sleeves, usually with fancy ruffles and lace. Then she pulled on one of her skirts, which hung no \u2018higher than two inches from the floor. In those Victorian times many thought it was too much of a temptation for a man to see a woman\u2019s ankle or wrist. Finally, she put on a matching over-shirt, with<br />\n\fa nice wide sash or belt to give the impression that she was wearing a dress.\u201d Lorene noted that she<br />\nnever understood how Mom could ever wear all of those clothes. But Mom did, and Lorene said she<br />\nwas always very stylish, attractive, and always looked wonderfi1l.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Birth\u2019s of Mary Easton\u2019s Children\n</p>\n<p>\nMary Lorene Hamblin 18 October 1910 Glencoe, Lincoln, WY<br />\nLela Eugenia Hamblin 17 January 1912 Glencoe, Lincoln, WY<br />\nMargaret Hamblin 25 August 1913 Lyman, Uinta, WY<br />\nRobert Lee Hamblin 5 April 1927 Lyman, Uinta, WY\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene wrote: \u201cMomma gave birth to me in the home of her parents. Mom and Dad were living in Lyman, Wyoming, at the time, because they wanted to have great-grandmother, Mary Ann Corbridge Hamblin, deliver Lorene. However, she had just delivered a child for her daughter, Effie Stoddard Pope, who died after her child was born. Mary Ann was so discouraged and shocked by the loss of her daughter that she never delivered another child.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cMomma was very ill when I was born, and three days later the doctor found that she had typhoid fever. She nearly died.\u201d Lorene also had typhoid fever and nearly went with her. Apparently she kept throwing up everything Mom tried to feed her. Finally, someone gave her a hot alcoholic drink made with whiskey and Eagle Brand condensed milk (a thick, syrupy combination of milk and sugar) and she was able to keep it down. Lorene told me several times that these whiskey toddies were the only nourishment she had for eight years, until Prohibition was enacted by a Constitutional Amendment in 1918, At that point Dad got rid of all the liquor in the house, because he didn\u2019t want \u2018his family breaking the law of the Land. Four years later our Uncle Eugene Eyre, Aunt Ida Hamblin\u2019s husband, fixed her a toddy with bootleg whiskey. She took a sip but said it was the most awful thing she had ever tasted! She never drank liquor again. Both of us speculated several times about the ill- affects of those toddies on her health, later as an adult.\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene remembered \u201cthe birth of Lela at the home of Momma\u2019s parents in Glencoe.\u201d She mentioned the Christmas tree with its beautiful trimmings and lights (candles) the month before.  Lorene wrote: \u201cLela was a beautiful child with blue eyes and very blond hair. My eyes were dark brown, and my hair was black with reddish highlights. Lela was like the Easton family, and I had Grandma Hamblin's coloring and build, except I was short.\u201d \u201cLela was a very bright child, with an angelic, pleasing disposition like Momma.\u201d She told me that Mother had said that great grandmother Mary Hood was sweetest, kindest person she had ever known. It is interesting that her personality has popped up in later generations. In mother and in Lela, for example.\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018When Lorene was about two years, ten months old, Margaret was born, in Lyman, Wyoming.  It was planned that Margaret be born in Momma\u2019s parents home in Glencoe, but \u201cshe came early as the result of an accident.\u201d In the delivery the doctor damaged Momma\u2019s birth canal. As a result, she miscarried several fetuses until Robert was born when Lorene was 16 % years old. According to Lorene, Margaret \u201cwas in poor health for some time after she was born, which caused Momma to be very protective and partial to her.\u201d She wrote: \u201cLela and I soon realized that whenever we tried to play with Margaret she ended up having a tantrum, which resulted in Momma punishing us.\u201d So Lorene and Lela \u201cplayed together and became very dear, very close sisters.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 1918 Influenza Epidemic\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 1918 bird flu epidemic (then called the Spanish flu epidemic) broke out in the Bridger Valley when Dad and Mom happened to be living again in Lyman in a rented house. Lorene wrote: \u201cIt seemed to me that everyone got it but Momma. She had become a practical nurse by then, and she labored long hours nursing all of her family, neighbors, and friends back to health. All of the women who were pregnant died when they contracted the flu, as did most of their babies. As many as five or six funerals were held every week. And every week my Uncle Gene Hamblin (Father\u2019s oldest brother) spoke at one or two of the funerals. I vividly remember that he spoke at a funeral one Sunday, then died and was buried the following Thursday. Father was also very busy, digging the graves and burying the dead. When uncle Gene took sick, uncle Bob, aunt Lucille, and uncle Marcene came to our place and Momma nursed them all back to health. Grandma Hamblin spent all of her time taking care of Uncle Gene, Aunt Pauline, and Bobby. Uncle Gene\u2019s death was a great loss to the community since he was a very good Church and community worker. I liked his son Bobby more than any of my other cousins.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nCumberland\n</p>\n<p>\nThat winter the family moved to Cumberland, where Papa again worked in the coal mines.  Many of our Uncles and cousins lived in Cumberland at that time, and my parents had a very pleasant life there. Seven men came to board with us that year.\u201d Mary attempted to supplement Lee\u2019s income by cooking and feeding seven people: \u201cUncle Peter and Uncle Andrew from Mommas\u2019s family in Evanston, Uncle Bob from Papa\u2019s family; and Leland Eyre, Clem Eyre, David Balentine and his two brothers from Lyman.\u201d Lorene wrote that it was a real education for her to listen to these young men talk about their girl friends. What they liked and what the didn\u2019t. \u201cClem Eyre and Dave Balentine both met wives while there. Leland Eyre also started to go with Laura Hamblin. He was so critical of her that I was very surprised when they were later married. Uncle Andy, Uncle Bob, and the Balentine brothers were too young, so they very seldom went out with girls. In fact, there were not too many girls to go with. It was unthinkable at that time for them to go with Greek, Italian, or Austrian girls because they were Catholics and we were Mormons.\u201d  \n</p>\n<p>\nPurchasing the Hamblin Ranch\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018When Lorene was nine years old, sometime in early 1919, the miners went out on strike in Cumberland, and the owners closed the mine down. Lorene: \u201cAll of the people from the Bridger Valley went home. Others went to the coal mines near Rock Springs. And some went to Salt Lake City. Dave Balentine went to Ogden, where he eventually became mayor for many years. We read about him and his wife in newspapers, but never saw them again.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nAt that time, Grandpa Hamblin had obtained a job as a mechanic at the Roundhouse in Green River, and he wanted to sell the ranch. Lorene wrote: \u201cMy folks went back to Lyman, bought the ranch from Grandma and Grandpa Hamblin, and lived there for about thirteen years. Grandmother Hamblin did not like Momma, because she had wanted Papa to marry someone else. Dad must have had some feeling for this other woman, because he gave her name to his oldest daughter.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, the ill feeling was more complicated than that. Lorene wrote: \u201cPapa had habitually turned over almost all of his pay checks to Grandma, and she insisted on his continuing the practice after he married Momma. Momma \u201cput her foot down;\u201d she said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Fortunately for the family, Papa sided with Momma, but Grandma apparently resented losing the income, and she never forgave Momma. Then when buying the ranch, after some negotiations, Dad and Mom agreed to the asking price, 1,150 dollars. But Grandma wanted to give Rollins, her favorite son, all of the livestock, \u201cbecause he needed it.\u201d Again, Momma said, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d and Dad sided with her.\n</p>\n<p>\nMuch later, after the family moved to Lyman in 1932 and Dad was out of town, Mom and I dutifully visited Grandma and Grandpa every month or so . Mom and Grandma were cordial, but the truce was uneasy. Grandma was the only person with whom Mom had difficulties. I remember her crying, complaining sometimes about something mean Grandma had said or done to her.  \n</p>\n<p>\nDiphtheria and Lela\u2019s Death\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the winter of 1921-22, Dad decided to move the family back to Cumberland so he could work in the coal mine, which by that time had reopened. Lorene wrote: \u201cMy sister Margaret came down with diphtheria and membranous croup. She was on the brink of death for three weeks, then Lela and I got diphtheria. Momma was frantic over the prospect of losing Margaret, and we were put into the back bedroom. Momma only came in only to give us our medicine and food. She spent the rest of the time with Margaret because she was so very sick.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n\"After two weeks I began to recover, but Lela didn\u2019t. Our room was very cold, and one night when she had a very high fever, she kicked off the bed covers. She took cold, which turned into pneumonia. Momma did not seem to be concerned about her. She still spent her time with Margaret, who was then recovering.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nLela turned to me for help, and I did all I could. When the doctor came to see us he told Momma that Lela was so sick that he didn\u2019t expect her to recover. Instead of helping Lela, Momma went all to pieces crying, moaning, et cetera.\n</p>\n<p>\nLela said to me: \u201cLorene, hold my hand and please don\u2019t leave me. I want you with me when 1 die\u201d So I stayed with her and held her hand. She passed away about a half hour later, on 4 January 1922. I got out of bed and went to the neighbors who had a telephone (the only one in our area).  1 called the Bishop and Clem Eyre, who both came to help Momma. Papa was working down in the mine, and they could not get word to him. So he wasn\u2019t there until later.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cIt was odd, but my parents never put me back to bed, nor worried about my recovery. The disease stayed with me and caused problems with my heart for three or four months until I finally felt better. After Lela was buried with a grave-side funeral in Lyman, we returned to Cumberland.\u201d  Actually, Lorene was troubled periodically throughout her adult life with mild heart attacks. She said her doctor blamed them on damage that resulted from the neglect of her diphtheria after Lela\u2019s death.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Ranch \n</p>\n<p>\nLorene wrote: \u201cPapa did not like farming too well, so he hired a couple of men to put in the crops and hire a couple of men to irrigate them, while he went off to shear sheep.\u201d My take was that he sheared sheep because it was so lucrative. He could pay the two men to do the farming for a small fraction of what he made shearing sheep. When he finished shearing, about June 1% each year, \u201che bought and butchered cattle, sheep, and pigs, then peddled the meat to Kemmerer, Green River, and Rock Springs. We also milked about ten to twelve cows and made butter and cheese, and cased eggs for sale.\u201d Lorene also wrote, that she was the only one that he had help him with the chores. \u201cI milked cows; fed caves, chickens, pigs, and lambs; and cleaned and cased the eggs. I also helped make the butter and cheese, in addition to the household chores that I did.\u201d In writing this, Lorene was referring to Margaret, who did not work until after she left home. Elsewhere, she wrote that Momma was also so busy doing ranch work and house work that she didn\u2019t have much time for her. \n</p>\n<p>\nVisitors\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene: \u201cMomma\u2019s brothers who boarded with us at various times when we lived in mining towns were William, Alex, Peter, and Andrew. Later, on the ranch in Lyman, Papa and Momma\u2019s home was the favorite place for their brothers and sisters to meet. All of Momma\u2019s and Papa\u2019s other brothers and sisters, their spouses, and children periodically visited us for day-long parties when we lived on the ranch.\u201d The families of Aunt Janet, Uncle Peter, and Aunt Viola were the most frequent visitors, as were the families of Uncle Rollin and Uncle Clark, from Dad\u2019s side.\n</p>\n<p>\nMomma\u2019s sister, Beatrice, and youngest brother, Uncle Thomas, came to Lyman to go to High School. They were more like brothers and sisters to me. Papa\u2019s youngest brother, Bob, and his youngest sister, Lucille, also came to live with us to go to high school in Lyman. Uncle Bob and aunt Lucille wanted to go to school in Lyman with friends they had known all their lives, not in Green River where Grandpa and Grandma lived. As I remember those wonderfil, all day parties stopped when we moved to Lyman. Afterwards, we apparently did not have enough money to finance them.\n</p>\n<p>\nMomma\u2019s Last Pregnancy\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene wrote: \u201cWhen mother became pregnant in mid-1926, her doctor advised her to go right to bed and stay there if she wanted to carry the baby to term.\u201d Lorene loved her mother dearly and wanted her to be able to have another child. So she volunteered to stay home from her junior year in high school, and take over Momma\u2019s house work and ranch chores. However, Mom\u2019s youngest sister, Beatrice, and Dad\u2019s youngest sister, Lucille, stayed with Mom and Dad that year to attend high school in Lyman, and they also pitched in. Dad did not leave to shear sheep that year until mid-April, so until then he did much of the ranch work. However, Lorene was always a very responsible, hard worker, and she cooked breakfast and lunch, tended to her bed-bound mother, and had the house tidied by the time Beatrice and Lucille came home from school. In addition, Lorene home-schooled herself during that junior year by reading the texts, completing the assignments, and taking the tests. Lorene was a very intelligent, hard worker. She got straight A\u2019s, even during that year of home schooling.\n</p>\n<p>\nRobert Lee Hamblin was born about 2 pm on Friday, 5 April 1927. Dad had let Lorene help Beatrice, Lucille and others decorate for the Junior Prom. Lorene loved the excitement of dancing and preparing for dances. After I was born, a neighbor couple volunteered to drive to town, tell the girls the news, and drive them home. When they came home, there was quite a celebration.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, I was an usually large baby, 12 pounds. During the birth Mom\u2019s legs were pushed out of their joints. That must have been very painful, but Mom never mentioned it to me, only Lorene. Much later, we realized that Mom had contracted gestational diabetes which made me oversized at birth. It was the first indication that she would later contract late-onset diabetes. I will always be grateful to Lorene for sacrificing so I could be born into this family. I dearly loved my Mother, Mary Easton, but I also always loved Lorene, who was always like a second mother to me.\n</p>\n<p>\nHow Mother Dealt with Me\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018When I reached four years of age, mother took me down to the spring where we obtained our potable water, about 200 yards from our house. We went down a narrow, slanted trail that had been dug into the steep hill, then along the bank of the Blacks Fork River, to the spring which was about three feet above the river, in ledge of shale just below cliffs. The spring had not been used all winter because there was fresh snow enough for potable water. Mom cleaned out sticks and excess shale, until the water was clear. She filled a gallon lard bucket by dipping it into the spring and asked me if I could carry it? I lifted it and said, \u201cYes.\u201d She then filled two other lard buckets which she carried.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore we left, she had me look at the river which was running high with runoff from the winter\u2019s snow. [ had been swimming there the summer before with Mom, Dad, Margaret, and other relatives. Then she said: \u201cWe only go into the river when we swim together as a family. If you go in alone you could drown.\u201d I am not sure I knew what \u201cdrown\u201d meant. But from that time on, several times every day, Mom sent me down for spring water alone, first with one, then two one- gallon lard buckets. I never did go into the river alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nTools for Christmas\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the previous and the following Christmas, Santa Claus brought me a little tin box full of child\u2019s tools. We had plenty of scrap wood on the ranch, and as soon as weather permitted I started building things with my tools, even though they were all but unusable. That summer when relatives were visiting Uncle Clark\u2019s girls saw me working with my saw trying vainly to cut some wood.  \u201cWhat are you building Robert?, one of them asked. \u201cA tat house for my tats.\u201d I couldn\u2019t pronounce my \u00a2\u2019s at that time and they burst out laughing. They thought it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Later in the summer, when they were visiting again, I was also trying to saw something, and one again asked me: \u201cWhat are you building Robert?\u201d \u201cA shitten toup for my shittens.\u201d I couldn\u2019t pronounce my \u201cch\u201d sounds either. They really laughed at that. Both times I couldn\u2019t figure out what they were laughing at, so I just shrugged it off. But that became a story that was told and retold at family gatherings as long as we lived at the ranch.\n</p>\n<p>\n1 mention these incident\u2019s mainly for two reasons. 1) I had no one to play with, so Mom figured out things to do to keep me busy. And 2) she let me use her kitchen chairs for a saw horse.  Eventually, the chairs were all scarred with several saw marks, but she never got on my case about it. We used those chairs for the next eleven years, until we left Lyman for Portland, Oregon. I later occasionally felt guilty about the saw marks, but never asked her why she let me make them. My best guess: my learning to enjoy carpentry was more important than unscared chairs. In fact, I did learn to enjoy carpentry, the trade of our Savior, and, as an avocation have enjoyed building things all of my life. From my example, David, Steven, and Krii, my youngest daughter also learned to enjoy carpentry. In fact, Steven and Krii have become a gifted builders and carpenters, true artists.\n</p>\n<p>\nChurch Attendance\n</p>\n<p>\nLorene wrote that when she lived on the ranch with Mom and Dad, she was the only one who went to Church, that she had to find a ride or walk the three miles to and from Lyman. But before we left the ranch I have faint memories of attending Church with the family when Dad was home.  Mom did not drive. But after moving to Lyman when I was five years old, during the fall, winter, and spring Mom and I attended Church every Sunday. We walked to and from Sunday School in the mornings and Sacrament Meetings in the afternoons, about six blocks each way. Sacrament was served in both meetings and both meetings lasted at least an hour and a half, the one with lessons after in classes and the other with talks by members. As I recall Dad attended when he was in town, which was not that often.\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018Who Are Those Men?\n</p>\n<p>\nPortraits of all of the Presidents of the Church, plus Hyrum Smith, graced the four walls of our chapel. 1often looked at these portraits and wondered who they were. When I was still five, one Sunday afternoon after church I asked Mother. She explained to me who they were, first by pointing to and talking about Joseph and Hyrum, telling me about the events of the restoration with all of the details typically included in missionary lessons. Then she told me the names and a little about each of the men pictured in the portraits, including President Grant, who then was the Prophet. She must have taught me under the influence of the Holy Spirit, because Mom had helped me to gain my first testimony. I know that because I remember saying to myself when classmates were acting up in Sunday School, Primary, and Seminary: \u201cThey should not be misbehaving like this, because this is the true Church of Jesus Christ.\u201d Now I also believe Mom was blessed with the Holy Spirit when she protected me from drowning by telling me to never go swimming in the river alone, only when other members of the family went swimming. I believe that because I was never tempted to go swimming alone; I totally believed her warning.\n</p>\n<p>\nShopping for Mom\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Lyman, we did not have a refrigerator so Mom had me go to the store for her, almost every day, either to Frank Hall\u2019s Grocery Store or to the Goodman\u2019s Mercantile. The Goodman\u2019s were called Jews, but I didn\u2019t know who Jews were, just that they were not Mormons. Mom would tell 1me what she wanted me to buy, up to a half a dozen items. She never gave me a list, and, presumably to train my memory, she just told me what she wanted. It was three blocks each way to Frank Hall\u2019s store and four to Goodman\u2019s. Hall\u2019s was a self-service store, I just told them what I wanted and handed them the money. They got the items, put them in a brown paper sack, and gave me the change. Actually, I enjoyed going to the store shopping then and have ever since. Mom always praised me for remembering, and I doubt I ever forgot anything. That has changed now.\n</p>\n<p>\nOther Chores\n</p>\n<p>\nMom always had me do yard work in Lyman. We had a push style hand mower, and as soon as I could push it, Mom had me mow the lawn every week. At some point, Dad taught me how to chop wood with an ax and how to carry into the house for Mom. We also had coal for our kitchen and living room stoves, and it was my job to go out to the coal pile, fill the coal buckets, and carry them into the house. Mom also taught me to help her hang her wash on the clothesline, then bring it in again. In the winter, the clothes would freeze stiff, but at the end of the day when we brought them in, they always thawed dry. That always seemed like a miracle to me.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth houses we had in Lyman had a tap with running water that was positioned over a wash basin on a cabinet. Thus, I no longer had to carry water. We also had electric lights; one cord hanging in the middle of the the kitchen and another in the middle of the living room with a bulb screwed info the socket. Thus, we only had to use our coal oil and gasoline lamps in the bedrooms.\n</p>\n<p>\nHalloween and the Outhouse\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, like on the farm, at these houses we had an outhouse which we used when we went to the toilet. About every second or third Halloween some of the older boys in town with their horses and lariats tipped them over as a prank. Dad and a friend would usually put them up, back in place over the hole which was five or six feet deep. Trick and treating was not a tradition in Lyman, in fact 1 first encountered the custom when my family lived in St. Louis, MO, between 1957 and 1970.\n</p>\n<p>\nMovies\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Lyman we had a small movie house that seated a hundred or so people and showed a \u2018moving picture with sound on Friday and Saturday evenings. The ticket cost ten cents. The fall after we first moved to town Mom got a job cleaning the movie, I think once a week, on Friday afternoons.  This made it so our family could attend the movies each week. She, Margaret, and I cleaned it together, which maybe took us just a half hour, since they did not sell candy, pop com, or sodas. I always felt grateful to mother for arranging for us to clean the theater, because I loved movies.\n</p>\n<p>\nLearning to Read\n</p>\n<p>\nMom and Dad taught me to recite and to sing nursery rhymes but neither ever tried to teach me to read. When I began first grade, in the fall of 1933, Mrs. Foreman, my teacher placed me in the middle reading group. The children in the highest group, about a third of the class, had already learned to read some. I felt inferior being placed in the second group. I don\u2019t remember bringing home books to read with Mom and Dad, like my wife, June, and I did with our kids. But I worked hard at school, enough to earn straight E\u2019s (for excellent) in all subjects for my final grades of the year. I still have that first-grade report card. From that time on I was always among the top students in my classes, in Lyman, and in Portland, but in college I was a B student until I returned from my mission in Samoa. June was a fourth grade teacher, and she taught all of our kids to read before they went to school. I did the nursery rhymes when they were little and, with June, helped them read books that we encouraged them to bring home each night.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThat Last Winter in Lyman\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the winter of 1941-42, after the World-War II broke out for the United States, I lost my job at Frank Hall\u2019s. Dad had been looking for work in Utah and was staying at Lorene and Mel\u2019s on their little farm in Hunter. Lorene and Mel invited the three of us to spend Christmas with them. I do not remember how Mom and I traveled to Salt Lake City, but we may have caught a ride with someone or, more likely, rode the Greyhound Bus. It was a wonderful Christmas for me, perhaps the best ever in my youth, because I really enjoyed playing with Merrill, Dick, and Shannon. I also always liked being with Lorene and Mel.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, when Christmas was over, Dad had run out of money and could not get work so he came home with us. He had money to buy us gas for the pickup to get us home, but none to tide us over until he started shearing sheep in late February. Mother needed stockings to wear to Church, so I went through the living room couch and the matching overstuffed chair. By reaching deep into the crevasses along the sides and backs, I found two dollars in change, enough money to buy her a pair of stockings. They were the first nylons that were sold in Lyman--woven thick, like women\u2019s cotton stockings. They wore like iron, for two years.\n</p>\n<p>\nRelief Society President \n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018When I was eleven, 1938, mother was called to be the President of the Relief Society by Bishop Clem Eyre, the father of one of my best friends, Bobby. She chose Verna Bradshaw and Evelyn Symes to be her counselors, in part because both had cars and could drive. At first, I took her call for granted but gradually came to realize that she and her counselors were making that women\u2019s organization worthy of the name.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecall that mother had become a practical nurse when the bird flue epidemic occurred in 1918. The epidemic was so deadly mainly because the bird flue resulted in pneumonia, which killed like flies. There were no antibiotics in those days. Mother saved so many lives by effectively treating the pneumonia using hot mustard plasters that people always seemed to catch after coming down with that bird flu. These plasters were made out of hot water, dry mustard, and, likely, some flour as a filler mixed into a paste with hot water and spread on a cloth large enough to cover the chest.  Mom them wrapped the patient in a sheet to keep the plaster in place, and covered them with blankets or quits to keep them warm. Lorene said she never lost a patient and did not charge anyone for her compassionate service. Mom felt she lost one patient, however. She had gone to a neighbor\u2019s house because she had heard that several adults had the bird flu and were coming down with pneumonia.  She treated three, but the forth who looked extremely sick refused treatment. Mom tried to persuade \u2018him to change his mind, but he shrugged her off by telling her to come back in the morning. When she came back he was dead. Mom felt guilty that she had not done more to warn him of the danger.\n</p>\n<p>\nRecall also that she assisted the town\u2019s doctor in delivering babies and in providing post natal care for the mother and child for ten days in our home, all for twenty dollars. I can\u2019t imagine how she made any money at that price. However, I never heard her complain, even when the husband never paid the bill. Mom just loved to take care of needy people and that is what she motivated and organized the women of the ward to do just that for the next four years, until we moved to Portland.  \u2018Whenever there was a death, someone sick in bed, a family in need of food, or were otherwise having trouble, the Relief Society Presidency were there comforting the berieved, assessing problems, giving care, and having sisters bring in food or otherwise help. Mom did not confide much in me about what she and her counselors were doing, but I found out about it indirectly, in a very impressive way.\n</p>\n<p>\n1 remember coming home after school during those years only to find a note and plate of food Mom had fixed me for dinner. The note briefly said that so and so had died. was very sick, or was otherwise having serious problems. She wrote that she and her counselors were doing what they could to help. When I would read those notes, I sometimes felt very lonely. When that happened, a sweet, warm, feeling of love came over me and these words would come into my mind: \u201cYour mother s doing exactly what Jesus Christ wants her to do.\u201d I knew the words were true, so that truth and the accompanying feeling totally comforted me. Years later I realized that Mom had to have prayed each time she left before I came home to care for the needy, that she ask the Lord to look out for me and help me understand. Those were my first experiences receiving personal revelation and being comforted by the Holy Spirit. I treasure them and am so grateful to my Mother for them.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Christmas in 1941 when we came home after Christmas with Lorene and Mel\u2019s family we fortunately had enough food to live on comfortably. We did not have a year\u2019s supply, but more than enough to eat for three or four months without suffering. Every year in the late summer, Mom bottled fruit and vegetables that were available in Lyman\u2019s two grocery stores. She bottled apricots, peaches, and pears that we ate for desert, and rhubarb which she used for pies. She also bottled strawberry, raspberry, apricot, and peach jam that we used on her wonderful home-made bread. She always kept on hand plenty of flour, dried yeast, shortening, baking powder and soda, and sugar that she needed for baking and for bottling fruit. We also had a good store of cereal--rolled oats, cracked wheat, and germade (a finer cracked wheat supplemented with wheat germ). Mom also had plenty of spaghetti as well as bottled tomatoes and tomato juice. While in Lyman, we had taken milk delivered by Bother Voss, a convert from Holland who was our Stake Patriarch. He had three or four cows that he personally milked, then did the bottling and delivert. He evidently let Dad buy what milk we needed on credit.\n</p>\n<p>\nThus, we had 1) milk, cereal, and toast with jam for breakfast, beans, 2) beans, spaghetti with tomatoes, other vegetables, and bread for our noon meal, and 3) bread and milk for dinner. We had no butter for bread, and no meat except three or four cotton-tail rabbits that I shot and mother cleaned and fried for us. We did not suffer, but I was embarrassed a little once when I was invited to eat dinner at a friends, Melly Platt\u2019s, house. Having gotten out of the habit of eating butter, I didn\u2019t butter my bread. Melly noticed and asked, Why? I didn\u2019t say anything, just buttered my bread without answering. It tasted good.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs noted, when Dad and Mom moved to Salt Lake City to work in the Temple, mom had been diagnosed with late-onset diabetes. She lost weight, probably 50 pounds, carefully took her meds, and carefully followed the diet that her Dr. prescribed. They first lived in a small apartment within walking distance east of the Temple a few blocks. However, Mel and Lorene had purchased a fixer up duplex on 11% East and about 6* South, two or three years before the folks moved to SLC, and as soon as it was feasible they had the folks move in rental side. They must have lived there for at least seven years, during which time Lorene took care of Mother, whom she loved dearly.  However, she wrote: that during this time she \u201cdidn\u2019t get to do much Church work, since Momma was very ill\u201d Actually, both Lorene and Mel were also not in very health during this period of their lives, so it was the sick taking care of the sick, except Dad who was in good health and who spent five days of the week doing Temple work for the dead. My family visited yearly from St. Louis, and found Mom, Lorene, and Mel uncomplaining and generally in good spirits, although we could tell Mom\u2019s health was slowly deteriorating. Yet she fixed the meals for Dad and her and kept their apartment clean, albeit gradually with more help from Lorene. Mel and Lorene had a pickup and a car, and Lorene always drove Mom to and from the Drs, as was with her when she was being examined and given advice. She was also working full time at Granite Furniture but spent as much time visiting with Mom, helping her every way could, and visiting with her. I remember Lorene being very happy with her relationship with Mom during their period. However, she was probably over- worked. Then there was the stress and worry about losing Mom.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn late May, 1954, I got a call from Lorene that Mom\u2019s health was deteriorating fast, that our family should come to come to Utah as soon as possible. The semester at Washington University was ending and as soon as I had turned in my grades, we loaded the car and drove to Utah. When we arrived, Lorene told me that Aunt Viola had demanded the Mom be put in the hospital, against both Mom\u2019s and Lorene\u2019s wishes. Aunt Viola threatened to call the police, if Lorene did not accede to her demands. Because of her diabetes Mom was beginning to have kidney failure, which was evidenced by edema\u2014swelling due to her inability to get rid of body fluids. Fortunately, we arrived in Utah so I could visit with her two days before she went into a coma, which lasted four days before she passed away. I stayed in the hospital with her the whole time, but since have felt completely inadequate in comforting her or in even detailing for her how much I appreciated all the wonderful things she had done for me as my mother over the years, especially her helping me gain a testimony-- a deep respect for and love for Jesus Christ. She taught me so well under the influence of the Spirit.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had two funerals for Mom, one in Salt Lake City and one in Lyman. They were wonderfully attended, and the talks and eulogies were given lovingly and respectfully. Clem Eyre, who had been Mom\u2019s Bishop when she served as Relief Society President in Lyman, wanted to give a talk but Dad said, \u201cNo.\u201d Looking back, that was an unfortunate decision because Mom\u2019s posterity would have benefitted so much from knowing more details about her Relief Society ministry in Lyman. Mom never said much about it, nor did she keep a journal. I could have interviewed Mom and Bishop Eyre to get the information, but when they were alive the thought never crossed my mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n1 can write now, however, what I really appreciated about my mother. First, I saw her as a totally good person-kind, loving, helpful, and pleasant to everyone. She was always that way to me, even when [ needed correction, she was that way. By precept and example, Mom gently taught me under the influence of the Spirit to live by Jesus Christ\u2019s moral teachings. For example, she taught me that Jesus wanted me not to engage in sexual activity before marriage, that if I waited until I was married I would please Jesus and would enjoy sex more with my wife more than if T did not wait. I waited and did enjoy sex with my wife.. She taught me so may correct principles under the influence of the Spirit, and then let me govern myself, which helped me to avoid so many mistakes in life by her wise, godly counsel. She also passed on to me a love for Christ\u2019s teachings, which resulted in my spending several years of my retirement doing the research and writing that became a book relating all of Christ\u2019s moral teachings to the two great commandments and the beatitudes. Because Jesus gave us what he called the key of knowledge, I have tried living each and every one of his teachings.  I still have a way to go in mastering some of them, but I have lived each and every one enough to have experienced the resulting natural benefits and blessing from God, which has helped me to understand them more fully and to know they are truth from God. My life has transformed from never having enough because of greed, to buying only what I need and giving the excess to the poor, which has pretty much freed me from conflict and given me peace--within, with others, and with God.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy Mom was a great woman. She made some mistakes, but her intentions were always good.  She became one of God\u2019s masterpieces created in Jesus Christ to do good works, those which she had been foreordained to do in this life. (See Ephesians 2:10)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nCELESTIA CURTIS DURFEE\n</p>\n<p>\nBorn 21 April 1832 at Ruthland, Tiago County, Pennsylvania. A daughter of Enos and Ruth Franklin Curtis. This was two years after the Church was organized. Her father was away on a mission at the time of her birth. Her father was a Patriarch in the Church. He had preached the first sermon Brigham Young had ever heard, and helped in baptizing him. She was the youngest of 14 children.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family was driven from place to place during the mobbing of the Saints.  Celestia's mother became very ill. The mob would come and order them out of their house. They would carry the mother out on a sheet, when the mob would leave, they would carry her back in the house. This happened several times, then the mob came and set fire to their place and burned all they possessed, This time her mother: had to lay out in the rain on a peppermint bed, until the dark of night, when the men could come and get her as they could not be seen during the day.\n</p>\n<p>\nRuth Franklin Curtis died the 6 May 1845 at Council bluffs, Pottawattamie Co., Iowa, from worry, excitement and exposure. Celestia was only 13 years of age at that time. She came to Utah with her father and others in the \"Bill Miller's\"Company. (This Captain Bill Miller was not the one that dressed in disguise of Pres. Brigham Young.)\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen they were crossing the Missouri River on a Ferry boat with all of their belongings a wind storm came up. It was taking them down in a whirlpool where all would have been lost. The people were screaming for they thought there was no help for them. Celestia's father (Enos Curtis) raised his hand and commanded the wind to cease and for the boat to stand still in the name of the Lord. The wind did cease and the boat stood still until the men on the bank could get ropes to them to pull them to safety. Then the wind blew all night. They could hardly keep the wagons from blowing over, This happened on Celestia's 18th birthday. They reached Salt Lake City on the 17 Nov. 1856. They came with three oxen and one cow. They had bought a wagon from Jabez Durfee, he had made it all out of wood.\n</p>\n<p>\nCelestia had nursed and taken care of Jabez's mother, Magdelena, called Laney Pickle Durfee, when she was very ill. She asked Celestia if she would marry her son Jabez. His father Edmond Durfee had been killed by the mob. She said she hated to die and leave Jabez alone. Celestia said, \"I don't even know whether he wants me for a wife or not.\" At last she said if Celestia would promise to marry Jabez she could die easy. Celestia promised her she would marry Jabez. Laney Pickle died 17 May 1850 at Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie County, Iowa.\n</p>\n<p>\nCelestia married Jabez Durfee 25 Dec. 1850 by a bishop and was later sealed in the Endowment House 21 Mar. 1857. They lived in Big Cottonwood, then later moved to Springville, where their first child, Maria, was born. Then Pres. Brigham Young called them to go to Cedar City, Iron County, Utah to help build it up. They lived there about 9 years where their sons Erastus and Elial and a daughter Deseret were born. Elial died when he was about 18 months old. He was buried there in Cedar City.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey planted the first orchard there and raised the first fruit. Jabez made the first molasses mill. One time when Pres. Brigham Young came there for Conference Celestia made some pies out of dried unpeeled peaches, sweetened with molasses they had made themselves. They thought that would be a fine treat for Pres. Young. It was a treat to them.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Lord blessed them and they became more prosperous. When they were released from Cedar City they came back to Springville. After they began to get settled again a storm came up and they lost nearly all they had. Jabez made a wooden molasses mill to try to get a start again. Later he got some iron rollers. They fared better. They made their own candles out of tallow with a string in the middle ofit to light it. Sometimes they would put grease in a dish with a rag in it to light. Jabez gave Celestia a present of a lamp the first she ever had that was when her daughter Chloe was a baby that was in 1864. At that time coal oil was $11 a gallon. Thenin 1867 when John was a baby she got her first cook stove for Christmas. The first meal cooked on it was Christmas dinner. Celestia made her own soap by putting water on wood ashes then putting grease in it and boiling it until it was thick. She also made soap out of ......7 or alkali and boiling it with water and grease.\n</p>\n<p>\nJabez made a loom for Celestia, she would weave cloth for clothes and carpets and rugs to help make a little money. They built a larger - 2 story brick home on main street in the south part of town. Upstairs they had a large room where the town's people danced and put on shows, a large orchard was planted on the land by the house. The children, Edmond, Chloe, John, LeGrand and Vilate were born after they moved back to Springville making 9 children in all.\n</p>\n<p>\nCelestia had another great sadness come into her life when her daughter Deseret married George Holdeway and on Sept. 30,1878 gave birth to a little daughter. Deseret passed away leaving the little daughter for Celestia to raise. Celestia loved the baby with all her heart and raised her as one of her own.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey lived through the grasshopper war also the Indian uprising. Jabez did all the finishing work on the first meeting house in Springville. He was a carpenter by trade. Then in 1877 Jabez went to Willow Bend, later called Aurora to take up a homestead. He became a successful farmer. Celestia stayed in Springville, with the younger children, raising a garden taking care of the orchard, drying fruit. Then in the fall of 1879 she moved to Aurora. A ward was organized on a Sunday, Feb. 27, 1881. Jabez was made a Bishop and was a bishop until he died the 27 Dec. 1883.\n</p>\n<p>\nCelestia carried on the work, also nursing the sick, caring for the dead. She was loved by all who knew her. Celestia Curtis Durfee died on 17 June 1891 in Aurora, Utah at the age of 59 years.\n</p>\n<p>\nChloe was born Aug 7, 1864. (She is the child who wrote this history?)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe year Jabez died had been a bountiful year. He raised 5,600 bushels of grain, besides a good deal of hay and other crops.\n</p>\n<p>\nVilate - 18<br />\nDessie - 13\n</p>\n<p>\n(Jim, your mother - Leora - knew all of Jabez &amp; Celestia's children except Elial and Deseret. Aunt Chloe and Uncle Legrand were very special relatives. I probably knew them the best although I was well acquainted with Aunt Mariar and Vilate. I also remember Grandpa Jabez Erastus Durfee eventhough I was only five years old when he died when a team of horses ran away with the buggy he was driving. I remember his blacksmith shop in Aurora and spending time in their home with Grandma, Sarah Elizabeth Kendall and Grandpa. I don't remember John Deuvaldi either. The Uncle Deuvaldi that I knew so well was the son of Jabez Erastus Durfee and Sarah Elizabeth Kendall - my grandparents so he was my uncle.)\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

His father died when he was was 21 months old. His mother took her little family back to England to live near relatives. The family was destitute and Charles remembers attending Raikes Ragged School, a Bible school established to help poor children.  When he was ten years old, he was baptized into the LDS Church. The missionary who baptized him complained after his mission that all he had done was baptize one little ragged Irish boy. Later when he was an Apostle, Elder Callis looked up the missionary and told him he was that ragged Irish boy.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe immigrated with his mother and two little sisters to Utah through the Perpetual Emigration Fund, settling first in Bountiful and later moving to Coalville where he worked in the mines. During his hours as a lift operator, he studied the law, enabling him to pass the Bar Exam in Utah and later in Florida and South Carolina. He served in the state legislature, where he did much to alleviate the bad conditions of the miners, and as County Attorney in Summit County. He served a mission to England when he was 27.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe met Grace Elizabeth Pack when they served together in the stake MIA. Grace was a school teacher in Kamas. She had a good education and attended the Brigham Young Academy in Provo. She was only persuaded to marry Charles when he suggested on a buggy ride that they kneel in the nearby cornfield and pray about it. His pleading with the Lord convinced her. They were married when he was 37 and she was nearly 29.  Those who knew them throughout their life often talked of the loving relationship between them. They were entirely devoted to each other through all their married years. They settled in Coalville but were soon called as missionaries to the Southern States. They went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, with their two daughters. Two years later, Elder Callis was called as Southern States Mission President. They resided, first in Chattanooga and then in Atlanta. Six more children were born to them-\u2014 two boys, twins, died in infancy.\n</p>\n<p>\nElder Callis served 25 years as Mission President, travelling by train, buggy and motor car over the large area that encompassed all the Southern States. Grace served as mission Relief Society President, raised six children, boarded the missionaries, and saw to the placement of many orphan children. During their time there, over 4000 missionaries passed under their care. In those days, members had little contact with Salt Lake City, and to them Elder Callis represented the Church. He was loved and reverred by all the members in the South. Many named their children after him. He was able to dispel much hostility and prejudice against the Mormons with government officials and church leaders. He passed the bar in South Carolina in order to defend two missionaries against trumped-up charges of murder.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn General Conference, October, 1933, Charles was named as the new Apostle to take the place of Elder Talmage, a dear friend. He heard his name read from the pulpit by President Grant and that was the first he knew of it. He and Grace moved from their beloved South to the Belvedere Apartments in Salt Lake City. He traveled each weekend to a stake conference, gave radio addresses over KSL, and published a book Fundamentals of Religion. He was a favorite speaker, an old-style orator, often punctuating his talks by pounding the pulpit. In 1947, a few months after Grace had died of cancer, he fulfilled the wish of his heart, returning to his beloved South to dedicate the first stake in the Southern States at Jacksonville, Florida. The day after the dedication, he passed away quickly in mid-sentence as he was riding in the car with his dear friend Brother Jenkins.\n</p>\n<p>\nPapa and Grandmother, as we grandchildren called them, were the most wonderful grandparents. I loved them both, and Papa was to me like Santa Claus and the Lord combined. How they doted on the grandchildren and what an ever-abiding influence they were in all our lives. They gave their lives whole-heartedly to their family and to the Church. This short sketch cannot begin to do them justice. Their daughter Kathleen has written a biography which should be read in each family.  They left a heritage which we could do no better in life than to honor and emulate.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The name is found in early records in the various spellings of D\u2019Urfe, D'Urfe', D'Urfey, D'Urfee, Durffee, Durphey, Durphy, Durfey, Durfeye, Durfaye, Durfay, Durfee, and others, of which the form last mentioned is the most generally used in America today.\n</p>\n<p>\nAccording to some authorities, the Durfee Family traces its descent from Henry, Duke of Bavaria in the sixth century A.D., through one Wiphe or Ulphe the Valiant, who went from Germany to France about the year 1127 and established the chateau in the south of France which was later called Urfe or Urfe\u2019. Ulphe the Valiant married Airnie, a cousin of the Count of Forez, through whom the D\u2019Urfeys became Counts of Forez and Dukes of Bourbon, as well as attaining numerous other titles and honors.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the latter part of the sixteenth century the family was represented by Honore\u2019 d\u2019Urfe\u2019, a noted French poet, who is believed to have been either the uncle or grand-uncle of Thomas D\u2019Urfey, who made his home in England and distinguished himself as a dramatist. This Thomas D\u2019Urfey or Durfey resided at Exeter, England, and was probably the son of a Huguenot refugee who fled from France to England in the early seventeenth century.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is thought probable that Thomas Durfee, the ancestor of the Durfee family of America, was a descendant of this line, as he is believed to have emigrated from Exeter, England, to America about 1660. In relation to this probable connection, it is interesting to note that the name no longer exists in England, is practically non-existent in France, and seems to have ramified and grown opulent only in America.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe immigrant Thomas Durfee settled at Portsmouth, RI, where he was married about 1664 1o his first wife, whose name is not known. By this marriage he had issue of six children, Robert, Richard, Thomas, William, Ann, and Benjamin. By his second wife the Widow (ne\u2019e Hall) Tripp, he probably had further issue of two more children, Patience and Deliverance.\n</p>\n<p>\nRobert, eldest son of the immigrant Thomas, married Mary Sanford about the year 1687 and had issue by her of Thomas, John, Benjamin, Peleg, Mary, and Elizabeth. Some of these children may have been born at Freetown, Mass., to which place Robert removed in the latter part of his life.\n</p>\n<p>\nRichard, son of the immigrant Thomas, was the father by his wife, Ann Almy, of Richard, Mary, Thomas, Ann, Hope, and Amey.\n</p>\n<p>\nThomas, son of the immigrant Thomas, was married before 1691 to Ann Freeborn. They were the parents of Ann, Sarah, Freeborn, Patience, Mary, Martha, Gideon, Thomas, Susanna, Job, and Elizabeth.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam, son of the immigrant Thomas, resided at Tiverton, RI He had issue, probably by his first wife Ann, of David, Samuel, and Joseph, as well as probably of a daughter named Abigail by his second wife Mary.\n</p>\n<p>\nBenjamin, probably the youngest son of the immigrant Thomas, made his home to Tiverton and Newport, RI He was probably the father by his wife Prudence Earle, whom he married about 1699, of James, Ann, Hope, William, Benjamin, Mercy, Lusanna, Martha, Thomas, and Richard, although some family historians mention only a few of these.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe descendants of these various lines of the family in America have removed to various sections of the United States and have contributed as much to the rise and expansion of the nation as their progenitors did to its founding.  The history of the Durfees in America is that of an active, energetic, and keen-minded race. Generous, kindly, often religious, and of an understanding nature, they have rendered humanitarian service to their fellow men in many fields of endeavor.\n</p>\n<p>\nAmong those of the name who served as officers in the War of the Revolutionwere Ensign Thomas, of Rhode Isiand, Captain Richard, of Rhode Island; Captain Benjamin, of Rhode Island, andLierutenant Colonel Joseph, of Massachusetts; as well as numerous others.\n</p>\n<p>\nThomas, Robert, Benjamin, Peleg, Richard, John, Samuel, Joseph, James, and William are some of the Christian names most favored by the family for its male progeny.\n</p>\n<p>\nA few of the members of the family who have attained distinction in America in more recent times are the following:\n</p>\n<p>\nJob Durfee (1790-1847), of Rhode Island, lawyer, jurist, Congressman, and author.\n</p>\n<p>\nNathaniel B. Durfee (1812-1872), of Rhode Island, agriculturist and Congressman.\n</p>\n<p>\nThomas Durfee (1826-1901), of Rhode Island, lawyer, State Senator, jurist, and author.\n</p>\n<p>\nZoheth Shearman Durfee (1831-1880), of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, manufacturer and inventor.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Franklin Durfee (1833-1899), of Massachusetts and New York, engineer.\n</p>\n<p>\nBradford Mathew Chaloner Durfee (1843-1872), of Massachusetts, merchant and philanthropist.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Pitt Durfee (b. 1855), of Michigan, educator and author.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coat of arms belonging to the ancient and honorable French family of d'Urfe', from which the Durfees of America are descended, is desribed in heraldic terms as follows (Rietstap, Armorial General, 1887; and Reeds, Descendants of Thomas Durfee, 1902):\n</p>\n<p>\nAmms --\"Vair, a chief gules\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\nCrest--\"An arm in amour\u201d, or \u201cA plume of feathers\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n</p>\n<p>\nReed.

Callis and Grace Elizabeth Pack\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried: September 4, 1929\n</p>\n<p>\nErwin had happy boyhood memories of growing up at the turn of the century in the rural area of Toquerville in Southern Utah. He was the youngest of twelve children.  He rode horses, herded sheep, plowed farm- land, raided watermelon patches, (he could always pick out the best melons) and enjoyed the delicious fruits raised on the family farm.  He was the only one in his eighth grade graduating class to go to high school. He served a mission in the Netherlands, French speaking. He loved the French language and at the time of his death could still carry on conversations with native speakers. After his mission he attended the Academie L'Francais in Paris, then completed his Bachelor's at the University of Utah, where he met Josephine.\n</p>\n<p>\nJosephine was born in Chattanooga, where her parents presided over the Southern States Mission. She lived in the mission home and remembers always having missionaries at the supper table. Later this mission was moved to Atlanta, where Josephine attended Agnes Scott College; she also lived for a time with her sister Kathleen to attend New York University and studied voice at Juliard. She finished her schooling at the University of Utah, graduating in English with a French minor. The commonality of the French language between my parents afforded them much pleasure and they would often converse in French, much to the dismay of us children.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter their marriage, they moved to Preston, Idaho, where Erwin was hired to teach school. Soon the depression hit, and their circumstances were meager, but they were grateful to have a job. Erwin taught French at the high school and then, having schooled himself in Spanish to help with the Mexican laborers, he also taught Spanish. He served as principal of the junior high and later of the high school.\n</p>\n<p>\nJosephine graced the small community of Preston with her beautiful voice. She sang for various programs and for most of the funerals. We children loved to hear her sit at the piano and play jazzy songs while Daddy would sing and dance. She loved babies and was a devoted and loving mother to her five children who love and honor her.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinding it difficult to support a family on a teacher's salary, Erwin found employment with the US Gypsum Company, where he filled various positions until his retirement. The family moved from Preston to Boise to Salt Lake to Indianapolis (where Erwin served as branch president) to Chicago and then Denver. Both parents served faithfully in each new ward. Josephine taught voice and piano and continued her singing for church and public occasions. Upon his retirement, Erwin became a real estate agent. They were called to the Northeastern United States Mission where they served in Bermuda and Connecticut. At the end of their mission they moved to Provo, where they became temple workers. Their home was a haven to many, especially the grandchildren who came to BYU while Erwin and Josephine were in Provo.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir children were taught to value education and encouraged to develop their talents. Erwin established a scholarship in Mother's name for vocal students at BYU when Josephine passed away.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nFAMILY HISTORY OF<br />\nLevi Newell Kendall\n</p>\n<p>\nMy grandfather was one of the 143 Utah Pioneers.  He was born in Lockport, Niagra County, New York, 19 April 1822, son of Levi Kendall and Lorena Lyman. He came to Utah July 22, 1847 in the Brigham Young Co. He was baptized in Michigan by Elder D. H. Hulbert in October of 1842, was ordained a Seventy April 1844 at age 22 in Nauvoo, Illinois under the hands of Pres.  Joseph Young, Sr. and filled a mission to Michigan the same year.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter his arrival in Great Salt Lake, July 1847, he assisted to plow the land and plant crops. With Orson Pratts' advanced company that entered the valley July 22, 1847, he was the first to start plowing, being with George U. Brown, John Eldredge, William Carter, and others when the incident took place.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe returned to Winter Quarters with Pres. Brigham Young the fall of the same year, to assist the \"poor saints\" in bringing them to the valley. On the night of June 5, 1847 on the \"trek\" here, he, with John Eldredge and Stephen Kelsey, was on guard the night a band of 15 Pawnee Indians entered the enclosure on the bank of the Loup Fork River. He was first to discover the Indians and together with Stephen Kelsey, fired over their heads, frightening them away, and so alarming the campers, they came pouring from their wagons with rifle in one hand and clothing in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr Kendall, John Eldredge and two or three others prevented what might have been a perilous and dangerous stampede in the Black Hills, the cow herd with jingling bells stampeded the \"head\" teams, the others following in the direction of and close to a deep ravine, but plying vigorously their whips over the heads of the terrified oxen, they soon compelled them to stop, thus preventing a serious catastrophe.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter his arrival in the valley in 1848 he was adopted by Brigham Young and married soon after in 1848 to Eliza Clements in Salt Lake City. She was born 4 March 1835, and came to Utah in October 1847 with Jedediah M. Grant Co., and in 1851 he married Elizabeth Clements, a sister of his first wife, daughters of Albert Clements and Ada Winchell of New York.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1856 he became a resident of Springville, Utah, where he assisted in the construction of canyon roads and irrigating canals. From Springville in 1861 he again went to the mission river with Captain John R. Murdock, to bring \"poor saints.\" to the valley.\n</p>\n<p>\nBrother Kendall died at Springville March 10, 1905, a veteran of Echo Canyon and Indian wars, survived by a large family. In the pioneer Jubilee of July 1897 he was of Mapleton, Utah while his wife Elizabeth Clements Kendall was of Oxford, Bannock Co., Idaho.\n</p>\n<p>\nReference: Utah P 983 - Utah Vol. 4 P 709 - Utah 24\n</p>\n<p>\nCopy of this history was received from Elna Irene Higgs....July 1966.  Elna is a daughter........... 815 LaVerde St. 1904\n</p>\n<p>\nLEVI NEWELL KENDALL\n</p>\n<p>\nLevi Newell was the only child of Levi Kendall and Lorena Lyman, and Levi Kendall (his father) died the same day as Levi Newell was born. Levi Newell was born at Lockport, Niagra, County, New York, April 19, 1822 and was kidnaped in his childhood from his mother, by an uncle to Levi Newell who raised him till his boyhood then he lived with his grandparents, till a young man. He heard the gospel, and left home for it and was baptized at Nauvoo and ordained a priest - to preach the gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was a member of John Brown's Company. He was one of the 143 pioneers who came to Utah when the Saints came to Utah on the 24 July 1847. Levi Newell, along with John Eldredge and Steven Kelsey was with Brigham Young when they came into the valley. Levi was on Guard the night the band of 15 Pawnee Indians entered the enclosure on the bank of the Loup Fork River. Levi first discovered the Indians and together with Steven Kelsey, fired over their heads, frightening them away and alarming the campers who came pouring in from their wagons with rifles in one hand and clothing in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Kendall, John Eldredge and two or three others prevented what might have been a dangerous stampede in the Black Hills. The Cowherd with jingling bells, stampeded the lead teams, the others following in the direction of and close to a deep ravine, but by plying rigorously their whips over the heads of the terrified oxen they soon compelled them to stop, thus preventing a serious catastrophe.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Kendall was with Orson Pratt's advance Company that entered the valley July 22, 1847. He was also one of the first to start plowing in the valley. Being with George Brown, John Eldredge, Willie Carter, and others when the incident took place.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Kendall resided in Springville, Utah for years, but moved to Mapleton where he resided in 1897. He died in Springville March 10, 1903 (I thought he died in Mapleton, Utah, but this sketch said in Springville.) He also fought at the time of Johnston army. He had a coat with one sleeve out and a fur cap. They made a circle on the mountain side and prepared to march around this circle and roll rocks upon the army in Echo canyon. This same year my mother, Eleanor was born on Jan. 14, 1858. So he and Elizabeth were married March 29, 1852. Elizabeth was born May 17, 1836, Liberty Clay County, Missouri. Died Feb. 1st 1924 at Oxford, Idaho and was buried there Feb. 3rd or 4th, 1924. She was reared there in Liberty, Clay County, Missouri until 1850 or 1851. I just don't know whether her mother came the same time as Elizabeth or not, but Mother has said Great Grandma Winchell Clements came without Great Grandpa Clements. He provided a wagon and everything for her, but he didn't come with her until years after.\n</p>\n<p>\nGreat Grandma Clements (Elizabeth's mother) was the one who insisted on Elizabeth to have Levi N. Kendall so Elizabeth didn't disobey her mother. But Elizabeth didn't love him as a woman should. For her mother's sake she married him and raised 12 children which boy Charles Clarence died in infancy July 13, 1871 and one girl or woman died in 1887.  They must have come about the same time anyway.\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth came with the Zabriski family and she took care of Mrs. Zabriski as she wasn't too well to do her work. Elizabeth walked along with the young people and saw a man then that she thought she may have liked. She may have loved him very much but before anything could be done about it a buck Indian saw Elizabeth knitting and he rode up to Mr. Jabriske and told him he would give him a horse for Elizabeth. The Indian bought the horse and Mr. Zabriske told the Indian she was worth two horses and when Zabriske saw the Indian meant business, Zabriske told Elizabeth she would have to ride in the wagon. She couldn't walk with the young people any more for they were afraid the Indians would steal her. She never got to see the man she thought a bit of and Great Grandma wouldn't let her go to Grantsville, Utah for there is where Elizabeth thought this fellow went to work. Therefore Elizabeth didn't have her choice. She took her mother's choice. It made Grandma Kendall impatient because she couldn't be with the young people very much but she knit for her family and took in washing and did everything she could to help with debts, food, clothing and everything she could for her family.( Is the man's name Zabriske or Jabriske. Both spellings are used in the copy I have.)\n</p>\n<p>\nLevi raised corn and would get it gathered then take it to the mill and have it ground and bring it home. Elizabeth would have to spread it out on the table and keep stirring it now and then until it was dry. Then they would put it away for corn bread. Levi never raised much other grains so their neighbors would save up crusts of bread into 6 quart milk pans and keep it moist and bring it to Elizabeth and family, and Mother has said, that bread tasted sweeter than any cake she ever ate. They only had a sugar bow! of sugar to last all winter. It was kept for medicine. When the children were old enough to help out they had to do it.\n</p>\n<p>\nLevi Newell also married her older sister, Eliza. She was born March 14, 1834, and died Jan. 2, 1915. They had eleven children.\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth lived with Levi Newell until 1890 or 1891 and then separated.  They got a temple divorce and has said she didn't want to be sealed to him again. [ don't know what she will do. She will go back to her mother and father Albert and Ada Winchell Clements, the temple president says. I don't know who the children will go to. I want to find out as soon as I can to do her temple work again.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is written from my mother's memory as I (Ethel P. Johnson Bowman) have written it down. Mother says they moved from Salt Lake and went to Springville in 1858 where mother was born and all the rest of the family were born. The people there built a fort around them wide enough so a horse would walk on top of the fort. Elizabeth wove carpets, pieced quilt blocks by hand to sell, washed for other people to help raise her family.\n</p>\n<p>\nSunday after their separation Elizabeth and some of her family moved to Cotton Wood, east of Downey for 3 years and then moved to Oxford, Idaho.  She lived there until she died in Feb. 1, 1924. She was 88 years old. She was buried there on Feb. 3rd or 4th, 1924. She was a trained midwife and nurse for many years in Oxford and also in the surrounding communities.  The Prophet Joseph Smith told her if she would go among the sick whenever she was called she would never have any sickness in her home.  The promise proved true. When an epidemic of diphtheria was raging she was very busy from home to home taking precaution of health when she came home.\n</p>\n<p>\nLevi N. Kendall had a clear, truly musical voice that rang out in church congregational singing. He lived in Mapleton Ward, where we were and regularly attended church and he sang about home which was pleasing to hear.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis above was written by Ethel Johnson Bowman, Aunt Eleanor's daughter and needs some correction. We lived near grandma many years before she moved to Idaho. After separation from Grandpa he lived with us in Mapleton while his home in Mapleton was being built less than a block away. Where he died 10 March 1903....the year I was married 10 June 1903. He planted an orchard of peaches, apples, etc. and a good variety of vegetables in his garden that bore well and was generous with all that he grew.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is being placed as information on Lorena Lyman Kendall because this is all we have. Is Levi Newell Kendall the only child she had as the wife of Levi Kendall? At this particular time she must be married to \"Howe\"....then is he the father she refers to. Who is Grandfather and Grandmother, Uncle Roger and Aunt Betsy, J. Smith, Abigail? Lots of research or study and work needs to be done on Lorena Lyman Kendall Howe's history.\n</p>\n<p>\nCopy of Letter written by Lorena Lyman Kendall Howe to her son Levi Newell Kendall, City of Joseph, Bancock, Illinois.  Bedford, Dec. 6, 1845 \n</p>\n<p>\nBeloved and Worthy Child;\n</p>\n<p>\nWe received your kind letter of October 10th, on the first day of December; by the hand of the Elder. The contents filled us with mingled emotions: sorrow, pity, anguish, and joy......sorrow that we must be excluded from your society here; pity, that you must suffer so much for Christ's sake and the gospel; anguish, that human beings should become so depraved as to desire the extermination of the innocent; and Joy that you are counted worthy to suffer persecution for Christ's sake and the gospel. Viewing all these things, we read it over and over again and the sympathetic tear flowed profusely. Your mother, as was natural, seemed the most unreconciled, but, in humble submission to the divine will, she now rejoices that she has one child bound for the kingdom of heaven. We also feel to rejoice that in all your trials you are blessed with health and as you seem determined to mingle your whole future destiny with the persecuted Mormons, we submit, and if it is the will of heaven we will try not to murmur. Go then beloved child and do your Master's will, and our prayers shall attend you. When we contemplate on the great anticipated remove, we are struck with surprise; and a kind of horror seizes upon our frames - 30 thousand exiled pilgrims to leave their native, natural and fair purchased possessions, and go, they scarcely know whither; merely to please an exasperated mob, is a stoop we think below the high privilege of God's anointed ones; and, although we know that persecution is the dowry of the saints, yet in their case something is unreconceivable. Yet peace is ever the saints mottos, and while they are traveling with their lives in their hands as a prey, in all probability horror will seize upon the heart of the cruel persecutor and all your wrongs and privations will reel upon his remorseless conscience, and when it is too late; he will wish to be a Mormon. But we will have the guilty in the hands of the Lord who will judge them righteously, and come directly to our feelings in the family circle. Grandfather and mother are enjoying a good degree of health for people of their age, and their hearts are alive for the kingdom and such is their zeal for the cause, that they fain would mingle with the multitude and partake of the trials and troubles of the Christian exile in search of the promised rest. They realize this present mode of existence will soon cease and what is to follow is without end.  They, therefore, request an interest in your prayers, that their faith fail not, and that in the celestial kingdom of God they may have a share. Your brothers' remain much as they were, jocose and rude. Yet they seem to sympathize with us and you in the parting struggle. They want to see you, and enjoy your society, but cannot believe there is virtue enough in your profession, to warrant a separation from their present worldly pleasures and connections, even would it bring them into actual profession. Your father is still in the opposition, but spurns the conduct of the mob and their associates, and like every reflecting man would be willing that the Mormons should enjoy their rights in peace. The little children are all well and often talk about you and in the anxious moments seem to wonder why you stay away. And know what remains is to realize to you a mother's feelings. Did she not herself believe in the doctrine of Mormonism, her trial would be greater than she could bear. But, as it is, although you are so dear to her, and your society so desirable, yet in view of the shortness of this life, and the eternity of the future, she is willing to resign you into the hands of a more able and faithful parent who is able and willing to support you, and comfort you in all your trials, and eventually to save you from all your trials and tribulations. Remember her in all situations. Your acquaintances are all in good health about here, except old Uncle Rogers, as he was called. He is dead. His last business in life was highly important....to put down Mormonism, but the old gentleman has failed and he has gone to await his reward. Peace to his ashes.\n</p>\n<p>\nAunt Betsy is living with grandfather and mother and they live very agreeably. You no doubt wondered at her anxiety for you and your safety when she wrote to you, but if she had not been a believer in the doctrine any more than she was, and hear as many stories from different sources as she did, we are inclined to believe you would have had fears like hers; first, the whole world's proclamation; secondly, almost every circulated story verified by Wm. Hurlbut; Third, the Rigdon apostasy, fourth, the conclusion of the whole investigation and judgements given against you. In this case there is no wonder for her concern. And your written assertion to the contrary does not wipe away the stigma. She believes you are honest and are deluded and led away by those whom she believed and many others fear, are wicked men. Spiritual-wife-ism, temple dungeons, and drunken swearing preachers cannot be fellow shipped in this region of country. Dear child, live to God, and may his blessings attend you. Remember us in all your trials. Those who prey will prey for you, and those who do not prey openly will give you their best wishes, Farewell.\n</p>\n<p>\nP.S. Write us often as possible before you start for the west, that we may have all the information possible. Brother J. Smith, acknowledges the receipt of your respects, and in return sends you his and his family's best wishes for your health and prosperity. As his mind is rather fluctuating he wishes you to see his daughter Abigail and let her know that he received her two last epistles, and they found us all in good health, but not prepared to move to the west; We are not able. I shall write her when my mind is established; at present I have nothing but prayers and good wishes to send her. Farewell, dear brother, and if we never meet again in life may we meet in the resurrection of the just is the prayers of ....J. Smith.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the hopes of immortality beyond the grave we subscribe ourselves your affectionate friends Hiram L and Lorena Kendall Howe and children and Joseph S. and Hannah Lyman and Aunt Betsy.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis letter was copied from a copy of this letter in possession of Grace Chaffin, 1st daughter of Julius Nathaniel Kendall.\n</p>\n<p>\n(Henery) 1895 -1916 Now in the hands of her grandchildren (I'm including this article from the Deseret News it documents what travel across the plains consisted of. Plus, it seems to me that the other information recorded in Levi Newell Kendall's life story actually came from this article. When the woman who wrote the story of his life said she thought Levi Newell Kendall died in Mapleton, but she wasn't sure because this article stated that he died in Springville.)\n</p>\n<p>\nDAY BY DAY WITH THE UTAH PIONEERS<br />\n1847<br />\nBy ANDREW JENSON, Assistant L.D.S. Church Historian\n</p>\n<p>\nSaturday June 5th....The morning was pleasant in the pioneer camp, though somewhat cloudy. The horn sounded early to start, but the pioneers were detained until 8:30 a.m. because several oxen were missing, About that time they were found and the pioneers pursed their journey. After traveling a little over four miles up the river they ascended a steep hill here the road ran very crooked. The surface of the country in some places consisted of very hard, uneven rock, and the wagons in passing over it were jarred very much. At the west foot of the bluff there was a steep, sandy descent. About half a mile from the west foot of the bluff the pioneers turned from the river, taking a course nearly west, and crossed the cry bed of a stream or a low gravelly channel which appeared to have been a part of the river some time ago. This place was about 15 miles in a straight line from the junction of the Laramie river with the North fork. The road, after crossing this dry channel, was considerably crooked and uneven. About a mile and a quarter farther the pioneers descended again into the same gravelly channel and traveled up it a short distance, and at 11:35 a. m. halted for noon opposite a very large spring noticed by Fremont as the \"warm spring.\" The water in this spring was very clear and soft, but considerably warmer than the river water.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe pioneers traveled this morning six and one-half miles. Just as they halted two men on mules came down from the south or other road to water.  They belonged to a company of 11 wagons from Missouri and were bound for Oregon. This company had traveled from Fort Laramie on another road which intersected the one which the pioneers had traveled a little above the spring. They said that the distance on that other road from Fort Laramie to the spring was only ten miles, while the road the pioneers had followed was 14 3/4 miles long between the same points.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile nooning some of the brethren visited the head of the spring, which bubbled out of the bluff and made a rivulet about four feet wide and three inches deep - enough water to run a common flour mill.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt 1:40 p.m. the pioneers resumed their journey. After traveling a mile then turned into a narrow pass to the northeast between two high bluffs and a quarter of a mile farther they came to where the road rose in a very high, steep bluff , at the foot of which was a sudden pitch. The road thence went over a rugged ascent for a quarter of a mile. The bluff at this point was rocky and many large cobblestones lying in the road made it hard on the teams. The pioneers after traveling on this high rolling land five and a quarter miles over a good road, descended again from the bluff, the descent being steep and lengthy, but sandy and good to travel. At the foot of the bluff they again crossed the gravelly channel preciously mentioned and traveled alongside the same about a mile, and then descended da little to the bottom prairie again. At 6:30 p.m. they formed their encampment for the night on the west back of a small team of pure water (Cottonwood Creek) and near a very good spring of cold water, having traveled in the afternoon 10 %2 miles and during the day 17 miles.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam Clayton put up two guide boards during the day, one at 10 and the other at 20 miles from Fort John (or Laramie). The Missouri company camped for the night a little east of the pioneers. They said that two more companies had arrived at Fort Laramie that morning, just as they had left, and that three other companies were within 20 miles of Fort Laramie. The Missouri company, which had left Independence, Mo., April 22, passed the pioneers early in the day. The pioneers found the road very crooked, but not bad traveling. About dark it rained some, accompanied by lightning and thunder.\n</p>\n<p>\nOrson Pratt write that the evening encampment was made at a point where the grass was very good and timber much more plentiful than below Fort Laramie. It consisted of ash, cottonwood, willows and box elders in the lower places, while mountain cheery, wild currants, pine and cedar grew thinly scattered upon the bluffs. The wild sage grew in great quantities and increased in elevation. The wild rose also flourished in great abundance and the principal herbs and plants of this elevated region were highly odoriferous, perfuming the atmosphere with their fragrance. A thunder shower passed over the camp just after sundown.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the evening encampment was made, George A. Smith and Thomas Bullock went to the top of the bluffs, where they found President Young, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards viewing the country with their telescopes. They could clearly discern snow on the top of Laramie peak.  An antelope was killed and the pioneers had seen signs of elk, bear and mountain sheep during the day.\n</p>\n<p>\nLevi Newell Kendall, one of the 143 Utah pioneers, whose portrait is given herewith, was born in Lockport, N. Y. April 19, 1822. He with John Eldredge and Stephen Kelsey, was on guard the night the band of 15 Pawnee Indians entered the enclosure on the bank of the Loup Fork river. He first discovered the Indians and, together with Stephen Kelsey, fired over their heads, frightening them away and alarming the campers, who came pouring in from their wagons, with rifle in one hand and clothing in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Kendall, John Eldredge and two or three others prevented what might have been a dangerous stampede in the Black hills. The cow herd, with jingling bells, stampeded the lead teams, the others following in the direction of and close to a deep ravine. But, plying vigorously their whips over the heads of the terrified oxen, then soon compelled them to stop, thus preventing a serious catastrophe.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Kendall was with Orson Pratt's advance company that entered the valley July 22. He was also one of the first to start plowing in the valley, being with George W. Brown, John Eldredge, William Carter and others when the incident took place. Mr. Kendall resided in Springville for years, and moved to Mapleton, where he resided in 1897. He died in Springville March 10, 1903.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nGeorge and Rebecca Hopkin Eyre\n</p>\n<p>\nMy father, George Eyre, was born in Dowsby, Lincolnshire, England, on April 8, 1838.  His parents, James Eyre and Ann Naylor Eyre, lived in a farming community where the farms were owned by the wealthy class of people. Very few, if any of the working class people owned land in England at that time. Although they were able to make a living, they had very few, if any of the luxuries. So little George didn\u2019t have a chance to go to school, except what they called an infant school. A place where mothers that had to work left their babies to be taken care of by a woman hired for that purpose. The mothers would take their babies home at night. So my father\u2019s only schooling consisted of learning to make pot hooks, as they were called, but he was naturally very ambitious, wanted to learn, and by self effort became very proficient in the three R\u2019s at least. His penmanship was better than average.\n</p>\n<p>\nRebecca Hopkin was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England on March 1, 1832. She was the second child of Edward Hopkin and Hannah Marrison.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer early childhood home was on a hill overlooking the dams that were the chief water supply of the great city of Sheffield and it was in the woods on the banks of these dams that she spent her leisure time as a child. There were all kinds of nuts berries and wildflowers that she and her brother Joseph had a merry time gathering in the fall times of the year. Her brother used to catch different birds and tame them, several of which he taught to talk. He\u2019d sit under the cage of the bird at night and whistle a tune he wanted to teach it. The next day the bird would whistle the tune perfectly. They also had one bird named George who would parade around his cage and say, \u201cSilence! Pretty George is going to whistle \u2018Sweet Kitty Jones\u2019 .\u201d Then he would proceed to whistle the song. Rebecca and Joseph entertained themselves with birds, flowers, and beautiful surroundings. When mother was very small she was sponsored to go to a school for girls by two old maiden ladies named the Harrison sisters. At school Rebecca was taught to knit and sew in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n</p>\n<p>\nMother was very apt at sewing, and at nine years of age won a prize of a pair of lovely wool blankets for best samples sewing. Her father was a brick mason and made good wages, so the family always had everything they needed in order to be comfortable. When still a young girl, mother went to work in a big steel factory and learned the file cutting trade. It wasn\u2019t long until she was making good wages.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather, at a very early age, was put out to service, as they called it when they hired out work for other people. He worked on a farm until he was seventeen years of age. At that time he heard and accepted the Gospel as taught by the Latter-Day Saints. He was baptized by William Padley, an Elder in the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the summer of 1850 mother first heard the Gospel as taught by the Latter-Day Saints After prayerful investigation and study, she was converted and baptized by Elder J.V. Long. She was active in the branch and was a member of the Sheffield Choir for ten years.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn May 1856 father was ordained an Elder and labored for four years as a missionary in the British Isles Mission. While in the Sheffield Branch Joseph F. Smith was his traveling companion. One evening while holding a meeting, mother Rebecca and her sister Elizabeth came in. Brother Joseph F. Smith watched them come up the aisle, turned to my father and said, \u201cGeorge, that young lady coming up the aisle will someday become your wife.\u201d After the meeting, Brother Smith told the people they were traveling without purse or script and they would appreciate any kindness that could be shown in the way of food or shelter. My mother, Rebecca (who had previously joined the church), and her sister who had never before seen the Elders came up and said they couldn\u2019t invite them to their homes, but gave them a Sovereign each, or 50 cents each in our money. Father and mother\u2019s friendship soon ripened into love. They decided to get married and immigrate to Zion, as that was the ambition of the Saints at that time.  Their desire was to save enough money to join the rest of the people of their faith.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe church started what they called the Emigration Fund where the Saints could place as much of their earnings as they could spare. When they had saved enough to pay their passage on the boat they were permitted to come to America. Mother, being a very economical person worked extra hours and began to save. Soon she had enough saved for her share, and almost enough for father\u2019s fare too. Father, being a traveling missionary wasn\u2019t able to save. Up to this time they hadn\u2019t told their parents of their plans, but when they began making preparations to get married they knew it was no use to wait any longer. They broke the news as gently as possible, telling them they were going to get married and immigrate to Zion.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir marriage was not opposed, but to immigrate to America was more than mother\u2019s dear old parents could stand. Her parents told her if they would only stay in England after they were married they would help them in every way they could, but if they insisted on going to America it would break their hearts. They pleaded with them to stay. When father and mother told them that they couldn\u2019t stay her parents were brokenhearted and said, \u201cIf you insist on leaving England, please do not come back after you are married. We could not stand to see you again\u201d. So for the gospel\u2019s sake they left the cozy little home where mother had spent twenty- nine years of her childhood, womanhood, and her parents, brothers, sisters, and friends that had her life so happy. She and her sister Elizabeth who was also getting married and immigrating, went to the Little Wicker Church with the men of their choice, and were married April 7, 1861.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer sister went with her husband to his family, but mother and father could not go home.  They stayed two weeks after their marriage with mother\u2019s Aunt Bessie Robison. She was very kind to them and made them a nice wedding supper and also gave them provisions for their journey on the boat.\n</p>\n<p>\nApril 22, 1861 they set sail on the vessel, \u201cUnderwriter\u201d with Milo Andrus as Captain of the company for the saints, with Hans Duncan and Charles W. Penrose as counselors. After drifting and sailing for six weeks they finally landed in New York. They came as far as Florence, Nebraska by rail, then hired out to a farmer there when they found that the company of Saints would not start across the plains for some time. Father worked in the field, and mother in the home, assisting with the housework and family sewing. Here they learned a little about pioneer life. By the time the company of saints was ready to start their journey, mother and father had saved enough to come with them. The nice feather bed they had planned to bring with them proved to be too bulky and they had to empty the feathers out. They spread the tick over the ox yolk to keep it off the wet ground and that was their bed at night. They walked the entire distance from Florence to Salt Lake City, giving place in the wagons the older people. Unless there was an Indian scare they would sing and dance around the camp fire at night. They were as happy as larks. The journey across the plains was beset with many dangers from the Indians, and also from stampeding herds of buffalo. One day during the noon hour mother went into the woods to pick wild berries and got farther away from the camp than she realized. While she was gone the company started, not knowing anyone was missing. Father grew frantic and asked a man to go with him on a horse to try and find her. They thought the Indians had picked her up. When they got back to their campground they commenced looking for her, and you can imagine their delight when they found her making her way back to camp with the berries she had gathered, not knowing the worry she had cased not only to her husband, but to the company in general. The Lord was on their side and brought through in safety.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey arrived in Salt Lake September 15, 1861. There they were met by father\u2019s sister Sarah and her husband Joseph Meyers. Father worked on the temple for the few weeks they were waiting for his brother John to arrive from Minersville where they intended to locate.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter arriving in Minersville they were happy to meet another of father\u2019s sisters, Charlotte Banks. They stayed for a time with his brother John, but as soon as they could, they began to build themselves a home. Out of necessity, the material needed to be native. They constructed a little shack from poles and cedar posts, dobbing the cracks with mud to keep out the cold and snow. The furniture was made from cottonwood poles with rawhide laced for chair seats and bedsprings. The only cooking utensils were a bake skillet and one pan used for a dishpan, bread pan, wash tub, bathtub, and many other uses. Sand was used to scour it clean after each time it was used. After a time they built an adobe room and put a dirt roof on it. Mother traded a wool shawl for enough lumber to make a door for it, then used some thin material she had for the window panes. They put a small bin in one corner to put their grain in and spread poles over that for a bed, so they had things more comfortable. Mother soon learned the art of gathering wool from the brush left by roving bands of sheep. Then washing, carding, and weaving it into cloth with which to make their clothing, also to sort the fine straws from the straw stacks then braiding and sewing them together to make their hats.\n</p>\n<p>\nMother said no one would ever know how she felt when she arrived in Minersville and saw how the people lived. They were more like Indians than white people. She said she stepped outside the first night and seeing a large enclosure all lit up, went back inside and said, \u201cOh! You don\u2019t have a circus here do you?\u201d Everyone laughed and told her that it was a home of a large family and the lights she saw was the campfire shining through the cedar poles that stood on end, and the fire in the center was all the lights they had. She soon learned that the city training must be forgotten. The luxuries she has always been accustomed to were all a thing of the past and her new life would be one of hardship and trials. Their faith in the Gospel they had embraced was everything to them, and they were willing to adjust themselves to the conditions, and strive to make themselves a part of a people who were struggling gain an existence and their religious freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was no sort of washers then, not even a washboard. Just two hands to rub the soiled clothes. The only soup was made from the carcass of perhaps a horse or cow that had died in the desert. The lye to make it with was procured by saving their wood ashes from quaking aspen put in a burlap sack and pouring water over it, letting it drip into a kettle. Then what fats they had were put into the solution and boiled until it formed a soft jelly or soap.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe clothes were few and of the coarsest kind, so their washings were not so large, but were hard to do. After the shoes she brought with her were worn out, there was nothing to replace them, so they went barefooted most of the time, to church dances and everywhere.  Though, all were alike, so they were happy.\n</p>\n<p>\nI've heard mother say that one time they were going over to Parowan, about thirty-eight miles away, to a conference, so father made her a pair of shoes from rawhide. The soles were put on with wooden pegs made from birch wood. When they started to go they filled a baking skillet with hot rocks and coals to warm their feet as it was quite cold. Mother put her feet near the hot skillet and the soles of her shoes pulled off. When they arrived in Parowan she was still barefooted. The men were most always dressed in buckskin. When it rained, or they got wet the buckskin would stretch out and drag under their feet. When it dried out it would shrink up to their knees. Sometimes a caravan would pass through from California and would trade calico or wagon covers for produce, and they would have a dress-up affair. The only dye they had was made from madder berries and rabbit brush blossoms. Mother had to help father in the field most of the time. Father had asthma very badly and was unable to stand the dust from the hay, grain, and corn.\n</p>\n<p>\nMother had some very lovely clothes when she came from England which served to dress her first two children very nicely. Mother was very skilled a needle and what she did get in the way of clothes was made to look very nice, even if the cloth was coarse.\n</p>\n<p>\nNo sooner had they started to raise a little grain then their thoughts turned to their native land. Father\u2019s father and mother and two younger brothers were longing to immigrate, and had started to work toward that end. Father and Mother would save what they could and put the money in the immigration fund here in Zion and help their family get their immigration money.  Father and his brother John both worked and finally had saved enough to bring their parents and two younger brothers to Zion. They were elated to think that they would soon see their parents again and could hardly wait. We can not imagine their disappointment and deep sorrow when they received word from their brothers that their mother had died on the ship and was buried at sea. Their father died crossing the plains and was buried along the trail on Hams Fork between Granger and Fort Bridger Wyoming. There was no marker to make it possible to go back and find it.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring these tears of hardship and privation, pioneering a new and barren country Father and Mother had nine children come to bless their home:\n</p>\n<p>\nHannah Elizabeth born January 25, 1862<br />\nHarriet Ann born July 4, 1864<br />\nGeorge Hopkin  born April 22, 1866<br />\nJames Edward born December 20, 1867<br />\nJohn Edwin born November 8, 1869<br />\nJoseph William  born October 28, 1871<br />\nRebecca Naylor  born January 22, 1874<br />\nElcey Ann born November 29, 1875<br />\nCharlotte Ellen born November 21, 1876\n</p>\n<p>\nTo support this family it required a great effort on the part of both parents; Father being in ill health a great deal of the time. However, faith and determination were two outstanding characteristics of the pioneer saints. They did their best to rear and educate their children. Giving them the best there was to be had at that time, which was not much compared to what we have now. The home training was not lacking as far as teaching by example goes. Father was always a sincere church worker. Soon after coming to Minersville on May 22, 1869, he was set apart as First Counselor to Bishop James McKnight. He was ordained a High Priest and worked in the Minersville Ward.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was constantly in the Bishopric of that ward for many years. He was set apart as Bishop on September 24, 1894. He remained the bishop for eight years until he was released due to poor health. He held many positions of responsibility in both town and county. He was a member of the High Counsel of the Beaver Stake, and also a member of the Church Board of Education. During the time of the United Order he had charge of the men in the fields, and the distribution of goods to the families. He was also an outstanding character in the community; trustworthy, charitable, and a friend to all.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Indians loved him. The old chief would say, \u201cIndian heap love George. He our bruder, heap like him. He heap wyno Injun.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nIn November 1903 he and his mother moved to Lyman, Wyoming where all their children but one son, George H. then resided. Soon after arriving in Lyman they bought a city lot from Bishop Samuel R. Brough and erected one of the first homes on the Lyman town site. Soon that little corner was the wonderland of Lyman and the Bridger Valley. Father was an expert gardener and soon had lawns, flowers, garden trees, and all that it takes to make an attractive home. He took pride in having his home be the best that could be seen even in much older and more cultivated places.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven though father was growing old and his health was poor, he always remained faithful. October 10, 1914 he was ordained the Patriarch of the Woodruff Stake, which office he held until his death on October 8, 1916. Mother lived seven years after father died. She died March 19, 1923 at the age of 91.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

His family moved several times, finally settling in Toquerville where he stayed for the rest of his life. He became a successful rancher and well-to-do through his industry and entrepreneurship. He owned many different tracts of land, one of which is still known as the Spilsbury Ranch on Kolob Mountain. He raised racing horses, and his riding horses sported the best trappings and saddles. One time his racehorse saved him by outracing some warring Indians. He often dressed in cowboy equipment, high-heeled boots, cowboy hat, and buckskin gloves.  He had to use a wooden bootjack to pull off his high boots.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe liked to sing and dance and played drums in the Martial Band.  On the 4th of July, he played in a fife-and-drum corps for the town celebration, riding up and down the town on a wagon, playing patriotic numbers to wake the people up early in the morning. He liked to square dance and shoddish with his wife at local dances.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe traded with the Native Americans in the region; once, to save a little orphan boy from being abandoned, he traded one of his racing horses for the boy and brought him home to his parents, who raised him. He bought goods from back East which were brought to Cedar City on the train. He met the train with horse and wagon, loaded up the goods and sold them in the Toquerville area. People in the area knew him to be fair, generous, and kind. \n</p>\n<p>\nOne great legend about him concerns some obviously haughty easterners, motoring through Toquerville. George Moroni was working at the irrigation gate when the people stopped, asking, \"Tell me my good man, what is the population of this place?\" George Moroni looked up and down the empty street and replied, \"Hell, I'm it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was able to attain only a meager education, never learning to write, but saw to it that all his children attended universities and supported three of his boys and one girl on full-time missions. His wife, Roselia, also made many sacrifices to see that her children got a good education.\n</p>\n<p>\nRoselia was born into a polygamous family. She was well- educated. My father recalls her reading to him from the classics such as Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, and Shakespeare's plays. She was one of the first telegraph operators in the state and also taught telegraphy. As a mother, she was a hard-working woman, rising early to take care of household chores, baking six loaves of bread at a time, drying fruit from their orchards, bearing and caring for her twelve children and suffering the loss of five of them before they reached maturity. My father, the twelfth child, was born when she was 47 years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was Relief Society president when my father was born and still serving at the time of her death twenty-one years later. Her service was noted in the church's Relief Society Magazine. My father remembers going around the neighborhood each Sunday with a large pot of chicken and dumplings and bread and butter his mother had made to give to the indigents. During the Thursday evening fast and testimony meetings, when there was a large space between testimonies, it was her calling to start singing a hymn and the congregation would join in.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe died from complications of surgery when my father was on his mission. Ceorge Moroni lived some 18 years longer.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

One of his converts was a young, lady, Fanny Smith. When Fanny joined the Church and decided to travel to America, her grieving father gave her a locket, telling her, \"T can warn you that those Mormons in their wild country are ruthless and will never allow you to write and certainly never allow you to come back to me. Send me this locket as a sign and 1 will know that your are sorry and I will make it possible for you to come home!\" Fanny never returned the locket and never saw her family again. George and Fanny married and worked to earn money to immigrate to America. George worked at his trade as a bricklayer; Fanny sewed hats. They left family and beautiful homeland behind,sailing from Liverpool and arriving at New Orleans, where they had to borrow money to travel up the river to Nauvoo. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere they were acquainted with the Prophet, Joseph Smith. All his life, George bore a firm testimony of the divine calling of the Prophet.  They suffered from the persecutions by the enemies of the church and, in fact, one day a bullet whizzed by Fanny and left a hole in the washtub she was carrying. In Nauvoo, George helped quarry stone for the temple and spent much time protecting the prophet from mob violence. He was a member of Colonel Pitts Band. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum spent many hours in their home. George and Fanny viewed the martyred bodies of the Prophet and his brother; George witnessed the transformation as Brigham Young assumed the mantel of the Prophet.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey traveled across the plains to Salt Lake Valley in 1850. They had alrcady lost four children in infancy. Fanny borc her fifth child in a covered wagon as she was suffering from the effects of cholera. The birth of her baby saved her life, but she nearly lost him when the thirst-crazed oxen tumbled the wagon over in the Platte River, spilling out mother, baby, and all their belongings. The baby was found, apparently drowned, downstream among some boxes; he was quickly administered to and christened Alma Platte Spilsbury; he lived to father a great posterity.\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge and Fanny built a home in Draper but were called by Brigham Young in 1863 to help settle Utah's Dixic. They first scttled in Grafton but had to move to Rockville because of danger from the Indians.  They eventually made their home in Toquerville. My grandfather, George Moroni, was the sixth of thirteen children; only five lived to adulthood. Fanny was known as a gracious hostess to important visitors to Southern Utah. The last 12 years of her life she was impaired by a stroke and was confined to her bed and chair, but rem;ained cheerful and patient to the end.\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge was ordained a Patriarch and was Sunday School superintendent for over fifty years. For seventeen years he rode on horseback through his area; after that he wore out three buggies and buckboards, three sets of harnesses and four horses tra veling over 30,000 miles in the Sunday school cause at his own expense.  In his later years, George lived in a small house by his son, George Moroni. My father recalls taking freshly churned buttermilk to his grandfather each evening before bedtime and then locking the door to keep him safe because he walked in his sleep. One night in his sleep, George climbed out the window and walked to the end of the road where he fell down a deep ravine. He lay in the water at the bottom which caused him to contract a fatal case of pneumonia; he died at age 95. He was stalwart in the church from the time of his conversion in England. Here is part of his personal testimony:\n</p>\n<p>\nThe question may be asked by some of my grandchildren, Did you feel disappointed when you saw him [the Prophet] the first time?' I will tell you.  All my troubles, and privations of leaving my father and mother, brothers, sisters and my native land seemed nothing compared with the joy of my experience when I first saw and heard him, the Prophet Joseph Smith, preach. I felt greatly blessed of the Lord in having such a glorious privilege.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

He grew up in this same area and became a Laborer at different trades.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe married Ann White at Heanor, Derbyshire, not far from Cossall, the 27 August 1817. His wife Ann White was born at Shipley Derbyshire, 21 May 1799, daughter of George and Mary White.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had the following children, John White Bradshaw born 2 February 1819, in Derbyshire; Mary Bradshaw born about May 1818; Samuel Bradshaw born 6\" November 1822 at llkeston Derby; Richard Bradshaw born 28 October (about 1824); Edward Bradshaw born 15 August 1827 at St. Alkmond Parish in Derby, as was Richard; Catherine Bradshaw, christened 3 August 1829 at St. Werburgh, Derby.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann were baptized by Elder Isaac Roome, 10 August 1848 at Derby, Derbyshire England. He was 52 years old and she was 49.  They were confirmed members of the church three days later. He was ordained an Elder 31 August 1848. Their oldest son John White Bradshaw and his wife joined the church three months earlier than they did. All of their children and the in-laws were baptized into the church in 1848 and 49.. This family of Bradshaws were the first Bradshaws to join the church in Derby, Derbyshire. John Bradshaw and his wife and two unmarried children (Catherine must have died in early childhood) Mary age 32 and Samuel age 27 were emigrants from Liverpool, England. On the 1 of November, but did not set sail until 4\" of January 1851, on the ship (The Ellen). After they arrived at New Orleans, they left almost immediately and went to St. Joseph Missouri and were registered in the Membership Records of the branch there in August 1851. | would guess they were about six weeks crossing the ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\nA company of emigrating Saints at Six Mile Grove, six miles west of Winter Quarters on June 9, 1853. Danial A. Miller was made Captain, and the company was known as the Captain Danial A. Miller Company. John Bradshaw and his wife Ann White Bradshaw were among the saints listed on this company, on August 15, 1853.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis company arrived in Salt Lake City, 9 September 1853. John Bradshaw and his wife Ann were again listed with the saints who arrived in Salt Lake City with this company. They came with another family by the name of Stone John, had no property (as wagons, oxen, or horses) listed to them. This company consisted 282 people, 470 head of cattle, 70 wagons, 27 horses, 154 head of sheep, and two 2 miles.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann White Bradshaw received their endowments and were sealed in the endowment house, in Salt Lake City, 21 March 1857 by Brigham Young. The same day their son and his wife (Samuel and Mary Ann Elsie) received their endowments and were sealed also.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat happened to their daughter Mary is not known. Some say she married outside the church, which made the family so unhappy they seldom spoke of her. She was last heard of in St. Joseph Missouri where she was registered in the branch there.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann went to Cedar City, Utah. For a while therein about 1857 they settled in Virgin City, Utah where they lived until they died.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw died 27 August 1865. His wife died 25 August 1875. It is said that John Bradshaw was a very particular man in many ways. He always did a good job, and always cleaned his tools each day. It would make him very upset if some one brought borrowed tools back dirty.\n</p>\n<p>\nDavid Bradshaw (a Grandson) told that after John died, his wife went to live with her son Samuel, and he remembers seeing her smoke a corn cob pipe. Of course, in those days there wasn\u2019t much said about keeping the word of wisdom, and she was considered a worthy member of the church. She spent her last days in helping those in need. She carried food and other things to an old Indian who had consumption and was left behind the rest of the tribe to die. She walked about a mile each week to care for him. She treated everyone with kindness.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth John Bradshaw and his wife died in full faith in the gospel and left a great heritage. One missionary promised him he would live to sit under his own fig trees, which he did. The following taken from Deseret News, Vol. 24, Page 519. (died at Virgin City Can County 25 August 1875, Ann White wife of John Bradshaw Sr. age 75, deceased, was born at llkeston Derby, Derbyshire England.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Isaac baptized his brother Hector, who is the great, grandfather of Apostle David B. Haight. The family suffered many persecutions. Isaac said he had three homes destroyed by the mobs.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1847 they came West with the Saints.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1853, Isaac was sent to England by Brigham Young to help a company of Saints immigrate to America. In this company was a 21-year-old convert, Eliza, who had left her family to come to Utah. The ship's log reports that she became very ill on the voyage across the ocean, but recovered after having a Priesthood blessing.  Because Isaac wanted to marry Eliza, he enlisted her in a company other than his own as they crossed the plains.\n</p>\n<p>\nSoon after they arrived in Salt Lake, President Young assigned Isaac to go to Cedar City to start up the ironworks industry. He took Eliza and another woman from the immigrant party as his second and third wives, sold his home and his belongings, and took his family to settle in Cedar City. In all, Isaac had five wives and fathered many children.\n</p>\n<p>\nEliza bore ten children and raised them all to adulthood; she spent many years away from her husband, first because of his travels for the church and then because he had to live in hiding the last years of his life. An account in Isaac's diary says he bought a log house and moved it to the Springs (Pipe Springs?) where he moved Eliza to make cheese and butter.  He died when she was fifty-four years old and her youngest child was fourteen. She spent her final years in the care of her daughter Roselia, my grandmother. In her old age Eliza suffered from dementia and for her safety had to be tied with a rope; one day she ventured too close to the fireplace, catching her clothing on fire. She died from the effects of the burns.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsaac was called to help establish the Iron Mission outside Cedar City. He was the stake president at the time of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. As a result of his association with this unfortunate episode, he was excommunicated. Because of pleas on his behalf attesting to his innocence, Brigham Young personally layed his hands on Isaac's head to restore his blessings. However, wherever Isaac went, he was rejected by his people. He was forced to live away from his wives and dear children.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe and some of his family were given permission to stay in the upper rooms of the St. George Temple to do genealogy work, but a group of angry residents, stinging from the ignominy of the events at Mountain Meadows, told him to leave or his blood would stain the floors of the temple. He went to the Mormon colonies in Mexico under an assumed name, but was finally recognized and forced to leave. His trip back home from Mexico was arduous, wet and cold and he contracted pneumonia; he returned to the home of his nephew in Thatcher, Arizona, a sick and weak man and died with none of his family to comfort him.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough there was great tragedy in their lives, they were a happy family, completely dedicated to the Church. Isaac was said to be an intelligent, quick-witted, good-humored man, tall of stature and well- built. He was entrusted with great responsibilities in the colonization of Utah and the industrialization of Southern Utah; he was one of the captains in the Parley P. Pratt expedition to Southern Utah, an ardurous journey across the mountains in winter. He kept meticulous diaries about many of these events.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot much is known about Eliza during her child-raising years (perhaps raising ten children says it all). She and Isaac saw that their children were literate and well-educated. My father, Erwin Spilsbury, never knew his grandfather Isaac; he was ten years old when his grandmother, Eliza, died.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nISRAEL BARLOW &amp; LUCY HEAP HISTORY\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael is the son of Jonathan Barlow who was born June, 1, 1770 at Granville, Hamden County, Mass., and Annis Gillette who was born in 1781 at Granville, Mass. They were married October 13, 1804. The Barlow progenitors came to America in 1626, six years after the Pilgrims landed. Jonathan died Dec. 16, 1820, leaving his wife, Annis Gillette with six children. Their son Israel Barlow was fourteen years old. He was born in Granville, Mass. Sept. 13, 1806 about nine months after the Prophet Joseph Smith, only a short distance from the Prophet\u2019s home.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael met and became acquainted with the Prophet. He was baptized March 16, 1832 and became very active in the church. He was a close and trusted friend of the Prophet and acted as a member of his body guard. Upon one occasion he was asked by Joseph Smith to take an important message to the Governor of the state, a distance of thirty miles. Israel delivered the message on one of his own fine horses. The Prophet advised him to start early, told him where to feed his horse for noon, where to get his dinner and that he should stay only one hour. He also instructed him where to stay over night and said, \u201cIf you will do as I have told you, you will go and return and not be harmed.\u201d At this time many people were bitter against the Mormons. Upon his return journey he discovered he was being followed by a mob. He watched carefully so that they would not hear him. When they rode slowly, he pulled his horse in, and when they went fast, he turned his horse loose. At one time he heard them yelling so closely that he maneuvered through the brush and joined them shouting, \u201cThere he is.\u201d As they crossed a bridge he was inspired to leave the road as if to water his horse. He road off into the willows and to safety, for the mob had lost him. When Israel arrived home, the Prophet was waiting for him. Israel began telling his experience. The Prophet interrupted to say he had seen it all.  Joseph Smith also told Israel at this time there would never be a time when he would have no descendants in the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael later became a scout for the church and was instrumental in locating Nauvoo.  At that time it was known as Commerce and was owned by Dr. Isaac Gallasid. An additional 135 acres were purchased from a Mr. White to complete the townsite.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the building of the Nauvoo Temple, Israel hauled rock from a quarry on the east bank of the Mississippi River with his team. He was known as a fine horseman and never used a whip. One day he was met by the Prophet Joseph who asked, \u201cBrother Barlow, do you have a whip?\u201d His answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d Having learned the importance of obedience he went at once and purchased the whip. A few days later while he was backing his wagon down to the edge of the quarry, the team refused to stop at his command. He immediately gave them a swift blow with the whip which stopped them and perhaps saved his life.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael Barlow was a member of Zion\u2019s camp and Kirtland camp. He tells of one experience when he was with Zion\u2019s Camp in Missouri, while they were camped the mob came to molest the Saints but a tremendous storm of wind, rain, hail and thunder descended upon the mob with little discomfort to the Saints. The mob became disheartened and did not molest the camp any longer. Israel took part in what was called the Crooked River Battle. He felt the protection of the Lord many times. After the Saints came to Utah they organized a group called Zion\u2019s Camp in Salt Lake City and Israel with his wives attended many parties with this group.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael Barlow married Elizabeth Haven in 1840 in the Nauvoo Temple. He later Married Elizabeth Barton, in the Nauvoo Temple. Elizabeth Barton, called Betsy, was preparing to marry a Mr. Loveland when one of her parents was stricken with palsy. She did not marry at that time but remained at home and cared for her parents for ten years and after that time she married Israel Barlow at the age of 43 and lived in his family the remainder of her life. Although she was a second wife and had no children she always lived in the house of Elizabeth Haven, the first wife, where she was known and loved as Aunt Betsy.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael and his two wives were among the Saints who were driven out of Nauvoo.  They came to Utah in one of Brigham Young\u2019s companies September 23, 1848. John Haven Barlow was born July, 27, 1848 on the plains. After their arrival in Salt Lake Valley, Israel assisted others in coming to Utah from the East. He helped them to locate homes after their arrival. He pioneered Bountiful, Utah by taking a farm in North Canyon where he and his first two wives lived until their death. He was an experienced nurseryman growing a great variety of fruit trees on his farm. He also kept several stands of bees. He was one of the pioneers in the bee industry. Israel and his family experienced all the severe hardships endured by early Utah pioneers.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael was a seventy and one of the presidents of his quorum and was a faithful ward teacher. He was called on a mission to England in 1853. He returned from his mission in October 1855, aboard the sailing vessel \u201cChamberazo\u201d. Aboard the ship he acted as captain of fifty emigrant Saints. Among the emigrants was Lucy Heap, who was born September 24, 1836 in Litchfield, Staffordshire, England. Her parents F. James Heap, born July 20, 1794 and Sarah Waters, born August 28, 1799, lived in a small birch house with a low ceiling and a heavy wooden beam across the center of the house at 119 Stowe Street Stowe Pool and a garden was at the back of the house in which all of the family was born and reared. When Lucy was a small child, the Elders came to visit their home. She was baptized with the rest of the family when they all joined the church in the summer of 1855. When Lucy was 19 years of age, she left England, her home, family and friends to come to Utah. Her sister Emma came to Zion several years later and was the only other member of the family that came to America. Lucy sailed aboard the \u201cChamerazo\u201d. They were six weeks on the ocean and at this time she met Israel Barlow, who was returning from his mission in England. They became well acquainted while crossing the ocean and walking a thousand miles across the plains. Many people perished on this journey including her dearest friend who died of cholera. This was a great trial and test of her faith in the gospel. She arrived in Salt Lake City in October 1855 and lived with Elizabeth Palmer (or Parmer) for six weeks. On December 2, 1855 she was married to Israel Barlow by Brigham Young in his office.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy went to the farm in Bountiful to live with Israel\u2019s family. She was a strange girl in a strange land and had many lonesome homesick hours. She had married into polygamy and sometimes felt doubtful whether or not this practice was in accordance with the truth.  She prayed that she might receive a testimony of its truthfulness in bearing a son. A year and a half later, June 12, 1857, a son Truman Heap Barlow was born to her and she rejoiced for she felt this was an answer to her prayers. Now she felt it was a privilege to be able to live in polygamy. She was the mother of eight children: Truman Heap Barlow, Sarah Isabel, Annis Janette, Emma Jane, Hyrum Heap, Minnie Rette, Granville and Nathan.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy taught her children the gospel and was a teacher in the West Bountiful Relief Society. She was able to go to the temple often for endowments, sealings and baptisms for her relatives and friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor several years she lived in a one room log home. Later they built an adobe room and later added an adobe bedroom and still many years later they were able to build a brick house which they enjoyed for a long time. At the time Johnson\u2019s Army came she moved with the family and many other Saints down south and camped on the Payson bottoms. They slept under the wagons and endured many other hardships.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a long illness, Israel Barlow died November 1, 1883. When Lucy\u2019s health became poor her daughter Minnie lived with her for several years to care for her. In the summer of 1900 Lucy suffered from a paralytic stroke. Patriarch Israel Barlow II, son of Elizabeth Haven, gave her a blessing and promised her that she would become well enough to walk again. That winter she was able to walk again, could knit and could attend her church meetings. On March 21, 1901, her first great grandchild was born in Star Valley and she took a sleigh ride to see him.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy wanted to go to Bountiful, but before she was able to leave she suffered another stroke. The children were summoned to her bedside. Her daughter Minnie Rette had just passed away in January. While all the children who could come were there, Lucy suffered another stroke. She said to her daughter Jane, \u201cDo you want to make me some nice clothes?\u201d They hadn\u2019t realized that they should make her clothes, but began sewing and had her Temple clothes nearly completed when she died the morning of July 4, 1901, at Afton, Wyoming. Her body was embalmed and they held a funeral for her in Afton at Isabel\u2019s home. The boys with Isabel took Lucy\u2019s body to Bountiful on the train. She was buried on July 6, 1901 in the Bountiful cemetery after a funeral was held in West Bountiful Ward.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nJames and Ann Naylor Eyre\n</p>\n<p>\nJames Eyre was born at Quarrington, Lincolnshire, England in 1793. The records show he was christened July 1795, the son of James Eyre and Elleonor Elcey. It is also recorded that Ann Naylor was born November 12, 1798 to William and Ann Naylor in the parish of Heckington, Lincolnshire, England. Quarrington and Heckington were neighboring parishes in the district of Sleaford.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs James and Ann kept no personal records, we must form a picture of their lives from the times they lived in and the nature of their people. Sleaford is located in what is called East Anglia at the edge of the Fens, where long grasses plentiful and used to thatch roofs over those who resided there. This was historically \u201cfreedom country.\u201d It is an area of England where Robin Hood reputedly roamed, and where Pilgrim fathers were imprisoned. Sleaford was far enough away from the cities to maintain the integrity of village life.\n</p>\n<p>\nJames and Ann came from a line of modest farmers and shepherds. Their people were tenants on land owned by the privileged class for centuries past. At the time of their birth England had a population of about 15 million. Of that number only 2% owned land. As only the land owners could vote, serve in Parliament, military, civil service, and receive an education, 98% of the people of England were dependant on the whims and knowledge of the ruling class.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis was the age of which Dickens wrote. The Eyre family lived with the fears of the times, when children worked long hours to earn the family\u2019s bread, and the threat of work or poorhouse hung over every infirmed or aged person unable to rely on his family or friends. It was a time when the Anglican Church and its bishops owned the land, privilege, and votes. It was a time when the humble were kept humble intentionally. James and Ann grew up with the fever of miracles of the industrial revolution: when the poor farmers went into factory work and found slavery of a different nature. Labor was paid cheaply with no consideration to hours, conditions, age, illness, or accident. Workers were used and discarded. This was a time of deterioration in health and moral fiber, of pollution and disfigurement, and of depression and hunger.\n</p>\n<p>\nJames and Ann met and married in the midst of the greatest depression England had ever felt. They moved southeast of Seaford to the nearby village of Dows by and settled into the routine of feeding and housing the children who were born to them. James was twenty and Ann was eighteen when their first child was born. James was a shepherd in an area of England where sheep did well. Wool was in demand as textile factories sprang up in the west. Wool raising was essential to the economy. Farming, up until 1840, was done much as it had been in medieval times. Fields were left fallow to regenerate, the farm tools were primitive. During their lives great advances were made in agriculture. Lincoln was known for its barley, wheat, and potatoes, as well as the cattle and sheep raised there. Roof-thatching was a common farmyard skill and we assume James and his sons thatched the roofs of their homes and barns. Until the year 1847 it is easy to picture James and his growing family doing work of the time. Planting, harvesting, carding wool, spinning and weaving. The Eyres were most likely among the number who saved their Shillings and Pence for their quarter-rent (paid four times a year). They probably participated in parish activities such as weddings, funerals, fairs, festivals and worship. They spent leisure time strolling the country lanes or visiting with neighbors and friends. The years from 1813 through the 1840\u2019s were hard times in England and James and Ann endured the depressions, shortages and hungry times with other Englishmen. During these times Ann Naylor Eyre bore 13 children of record. They buried their sixth child, seven month old Charlotte in April of 1827, and a twin son Robert, two days after his birth in 1840. In 1845 Ann gave birth to Edwin, her last child. She was 46 years old. Her oldest child, James, was then 28 years old. For her time, she must have been a woman of strong constitution and robust health.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1837 the first missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints arrived in England. The missionaries sent from America represented a double appeal. First, they brought a new vision of spiritual power. The knowledge that the Gospel was restored held logic, and was carried by aggressive messengers. The story of the vision of the prophet Joseph Smith rang true in the hearts and minds of the people. The presentation of the Book of Mormon was evidence.  The declarations by the three and eight witnesses were believable. The message of the Book of Mormon was a reality, and understandably, another testament of Jesus Christ. It added light and knowledge and truth not known to this pious and bible oriented people. The restored gospel so profound, yet simple, lifted the darkness of the spiritual drought. Tens of thousands of people joined the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second appeal was a new hope that there would be relief from the various powers holding them in bondage. There was also an added hope that if they could go to America there would be unlimited opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe know that James was baptized March 16, 1847 by Joseph Banks. He states in his own handwritten journal, \u201cIn the spring of 1847 I baptized Father Eyre into the Church and Kingdom of our Father and he stood firm until his death.\u201d We know that Ann and her oldest son James, and daughter Sarah, the ninth child, were baptized in November of 1847. We have records of the baptisms of all the Eyre children at various times, with the exceptions of Ann and Elsie.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the time of the first baptism in the Eyre family James was 52 years old and Ann was 49. The youngest of their 13 living children was Edwin, who was two years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nJames III, the oldest child, was 31 years old and still living at home. He would not marry for another 10 to 11 years, when he was about 42. It seems however, that he was a great help and support to his father and was like another bread-winner to this large family.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnn, the second child, had married Robert Banks, had one daughter in 1838 and was widowed. She then married Francis Dobney. In the spring of 1847 she gave birth to the first of six Dobney children.\n</p>\n<p>\nEllen had married William Banks in 1841, and in 1843 they departed for Australia with their two children.\n</p>\n<p>\nWilliam was 25 years old at the time, however, little is known about him.\n</p>\n<p>\nElsie was at home in 1847. She was 23 and would marry John Watts 4 years later. She came under the influence of the gospel, but we know very little of her life, and have no record of her baptism.\n</p>\n<p>\nCharlotte was married to Joseph Banks in August of 1846. Her husband had been a member of the church since August 1845. Joseph Banks is a significant and central figure in the Eyre and Banks families. Members of both families joined the church as Joseph led the way.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn was 15 at the time his parents entered the church, but he was not baptized until he was 19 years old in 1851. John Eyre was baptized by another Banks brother, also named John.\n</p>\n<p>\nSarah was 12 years old. In November of 1847 she was baptized along with her mother.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe three youngest sons, George, Benjamin, and Edwin were 9, 7, and 2 respectively.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom various reports and inferences, we know that James and Ann embraced the gospel in every facet of their lives. James expressed many times after becoming a member of the church that he never knew what real joy was until he became a Latter-Day Saint. One of his favorite songs that he loved to sing at the fireside was this: \u201cA Mormon father loves to see his Mormon family all agree. With prattling infant in his knee, cries, \u201cDaddy, I'm a Mormon.\u201d Ha, the merry, ho the merry, ha the merry Mormon.\u201d The Eyre family read the scriptures, had prayers together, attended meetings, and prepared their sons for missions. As soon as the call to gather to Zion was issued, the Eyres began to think in terms of immigrating. They saved and deposited into the Perpetual Emigration Fund. Some have mentioned the monetary assistance from the oldest son James in this regard.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough the older daughters were married, Ann still had the responsibility of young children. The gospel was central to all they did. Survival and everyday work was a great care and responsibility in which every family member participated.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1855 James and Ann and three sons were turned out of their home by a minister of the Church of England because they belonged to the LDS Church. The minister told them they could live in one of his houses if they would renounce their LDS Church membership. However, James responded, \u201cMy religion is a pure and undefiled one. It is the religion of the Lord, Jesus Christ and I would not give it up for your house or this town or all that my eyes ever beheld.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nWe do not know where they went to live at that time. Possibly they resided with other family members. It had been nearly eight years since their baptism. James was 60 years old and Ann was 57.\n</p>\n<p>\n1855 was a transition time for the Eyre family. Ann (daughter) was well married to her second husband. Ellen and Charlotte had married two Banks brothers, William and Joseph, and had left to try their fortunes in Australia. Australia beckoned many Englishmen in those years.  Over a million left to try the sheep trade or mine for gold. John made his way to Utah, married, and settled in Parowan. Sarah, still a young girl, left shortly after John in the spring if 1855 for America. Also at this time George was preparing for his mission. The immediate family was shrinking and being pulled apart by three continents. George later served his mission in Yorkshire and married Rebecca Hopkin. They then also immigrated to Utah. By 1858 word was received that Sarah, who had been working in Cincinnati, had married Joseph Myers in Ohio.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1855, news arrived that Charlotte and Ellen had left Australia and were in route to Utah via California. Their arrival took nearly three years. By the year 1864 the infrequent mail brought James and Ann word that a nucleus of their family had been established at a place called Minersville, Utah, and their children in Zion were beckoning. In Minersville were Ellen, Charlotte, John, Sarah, and George. Now the dilemma: to go or to stay. James was nearing 70 and Ann was 67. The journey would be hard and the separation from James III, Ann, William, and Elsie, and their grandchildren would most likely be permanent. The pull to leave England was great. England was not a welcomed place for the aged. Older people were dependant on their children, who were themselves struggling under the strain of the times. Also to consider were Edwin and Benjamin, who were not boys, but men of 20 and 25 and had limited opportunities in their future. The decision was finally made to comply with their self-imposed call to go to Zion, to leave their home in Dowsby and establish themselves in Utah with the saints and their family.\n</p>\n<p>\nJames and Ann and their sons Benjamin and Edwin made their preparations, said their goodbyes, and set sail for America April 20, 1865 on the Bellwood. Their voyage was harsh and uncomfortable. They ate salt pork, dried peas, and hardtack, and drank poor water and bad tea. A few weeks after they had left England, Ann, whose age and health could not endure the food and the tossing sea, became ill and died toward the end of May 1865. She was buried in the Atlantic Ocean. James received a testimony as to the evidence of life after death when shortly after her passing, he felt her touch him on the arm and cheek. He had no doubt it was his wife, and this lightened the burden of his sorrow. They landed in New York at Castle Gardens on June 1, 1865 after a journey of about six weeks. James and his sons then proceeded by train to St. Joseph, Missouri, and took a boat a few miles up river to a city called Wyoming. There Edwin and Benjamin were able to hire on to drive ox teams for a freight company traveling to Utah for $50 a month and free transportation for their father. This was their first experience working with oxen. It was a difficult journey as the streams had no bridges and Indians and wild animals roamed the prairies. There was trouble with the wagon masters of the fright company who were vile, corrupt, and ungodly men. They had difficulties crossing the Platte River, at what is now Casper, Wyoming. The drivers usually crossed the streams with shoes off and pants rolled up.  Their legs and feet became sore.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the early part of September as the company was traveling up what was called Bitter Creek in Wyoming, a heavy snow fell, thus hindering their progress. It was here in the cold that James became ill. During his sickness a special wagon was provided for him. His sons were only able to spend a few moments each day with their father because of their labors. A few weeks after becoming ill James died. The boys then faced the task of preparing their father for burial.  James Eyre was buried by the side of the wagon trail on Ham\u2019s Fork in Wyoming not far from Fort Bridger.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lives of James and Ann Naylor Eyre began before 1800, in England, and ended like so many others who heeded the call to Zion... in the depths of the ocean and amidst the sagebrush beside a lonely trail. Although they were unable to complete their journey and join their children in Minersville, the legacy they had begun continued on in the lives of their children.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Perhaps you can locate more. John Pack Was a very colorful pioneer ancestor.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn and Julia were living in New York State when his parents were converted to The Church. Not long after, being taught By Heber C. Kimball and Joseph Smith, Sr., John and Julia were baptized, and a year later they moved to Kirtland. They suffered there through many persecutions and moved with the Saints to Nauvoo. John was a major in the Nauvoo Legion. At one time the Prophet was seized by a gang of men who carried him off in a wagon. John rode furiously at the head of 24 horsemen to catch the wagon. They were able to escort the Prophet safely back to Nauvoo.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn was chosen to be in the first pioneer company to go West to the Salt Lake Valley. He left his family at Winter Quarters. He was an advance scout for the party and participated in buffalo hunts. He had never shot a buffalo but was chosen for the hunt because, in his own words, \u201cBrigham Young thought I could do anything!\u201d John entered the Salt Lake Valley ahead of Brigham Young, who was sick. John was one of eight men who went into the valley on July 22 to begin planting crops and deciding where the people should settle. On the 24t he led the small rear company which included Brigham Young into the valley. His statue is on the \u201cThis Is the Place Monument\u201d at the mouth of Emigration Canyon.\n</p>\n<p>\nJulia was only fifteen years old when she married John. After their move to Kirtland, they endured the mob persecutions against the Church. One time, she and John were riding by wagon to visit his ill sister. A company of about 30 armed men began passing them when the leader wheeled about, rode up to the wagon and asked if they were Mormons. John said they were. The leader of the gang, a Protestant minister, ordered John to take his valise and follow them, saying, \u201cWe take you for a spy.\u201d He told Julia, \u201cYou can bid your husband goodbye. You will never see him again. Julia replied, \u201cIf my husband dies, I will die with him.\u201d But John whispered to her that she must stay there and he would be back soon. The mob took him a ways off and the leader said, \u201cWe are going to kill you unless you will deny Joe Smith.\u201d John replied: \u201cJoseph Smith is a Prophet of God. You profess to be a preacher of righteousness and so do L. I'll meet you at the Day of Judgment.\u201d None of the men in the mob seemed willing to pull the trigger. Finally a man called out, \u201cLet that damned Mormon go!\u201d John returned and they continued their journey.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause of mob activity, John and Julia moved to Far West where they built a one-room house. It was the last house of the city. There were twenty people staying in that one cold room.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1850 the University of Deseret, which later became the University of Utah, was organized in their Salt Lake home. John had seven wives and a large posterity.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nJOHN WILLIAMS AND MARY PARRY HISTORIES\n</p>\n<p>\nThe father of John Williams was Thomas Williams and his mother\u2019s name was Anne. They occupied a farm named \u201cPant Efan\u201d located along the main road near Rhualt, Flintshire, North Wales. This small hamlet was half in the parish of Cwm and half in the parish of Tremeirchion.  John was their second son and he was born 11 January 1817. He was christened in the Tremeirchion parish church. Anne and Thomas continued to farm at Pant Efan until about 1824 While they were there they had four children. Thomas then moved to Newmarket where he rented a farm called Ochr y Gop. Two daughters were born at this farm and Thomas\u2019s wife Anne died there in 1837, of either consumption or in terms of the death certificate, \u201cchronic inflammation of he lungs\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore John\u2019s mother died, John 19 years old married and returned to Ochr y Gop where he had been helping his father to run the 100 acre farm which required plenty of help. John had married Mary Parry on 4 March 1836. She was three and a half years older than John. It was not an uncommon custom for families to live together in rural Wales. It is difficult to determine what happened to his older brother Edward. There are many Edward Williams on the records it is hard to determine which is which. At least he was not at Ochr y Gop. John had two younger brothers who were twins, Roger and Ruben. By 1841 they were separated as only Reuben is listed at the farm at 15 years of age. perhaps Roger had died by this time. Rueben, however, is listed on the Newmarket census of 1861 as married and with children and is listed as a lead miner.\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon the death of the mother. John\u2019s wife, assumed the \u2018farm wife\u2019s\u201d responsibilities in her place.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 1841 census of Newmarket lists John and Mary.\n</p>\n<p>\nThomas Williams 40*<br />\nJohn 20<br />\nMary 25<br />\nRueben 15<br />\nMary 4<br />\nElizabeth 2<br />\nSarah 1<br />\nAlso 3 servants. * Ages gives the number in increments of 5 closest to age of person.\n</p>\n<p>\nMary, Sarah, and Elizabeth are John and Mary\u2019s children. They are still in residence in 1851 and a bit more information is included in this census: Thomas Williams 60 Widower, head of family, farmer of 100 acres.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Williams 34 Married son, farm laborer\n</p>\n<p>\nMary Williams 36 Married daughter-in-law, housewife<br />\nElizabeth 13 granddaughter<br />\nSarah 11 granddaughter<br />\nAnn 9 granddaughter<br />\nJane 7 granddaughter<br />\nEdward 2 grandson<br />\nand 3 farm servants.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis census indicates that John Williams daughter Mary has died His brother Reuben has died or at age 25 he no longer lives there.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family of John Parry and Mary Williams Parry also lived on the farm at Ochr y Gop. In 1846 they moved to Birkenhead, England about 15 miles straight north. Todays maps of Wales do not show Newmarket, but do show Mold, where the main parish was for the Newmarket area.  They remained there for two years after which they returned two years later full of the restored gospel to which they had been converted. John Williams wife Mary was the daughter of John Parry. Mary accepted the teaching of her father and mother and was baptized before her parents returned to Birkenhead and left with the Buena Vista group for Utah. Many of the people in the Newmarket area became interested in the Mormonism and were baptized, they joined together in small branches to worship, and either became disillusioned rather quickly of gathered for emigration to Zion and left.\n</p>\n<p>\nA rather imaginative bit of faith healing involved John Williams. Yet it is doubtful that he joined the Mormon Church during this period The faith healing story comes from the journal of John Parry Jr. (and could have been written to impress the reader rather that to report the actual facts). It involves the restoration of John William\u2019s cancer-destroyed tongue and jaw. Whether John Williams was baptized then or later (1870). Nevertheless he left his father and his farm laboring to emigrate with Mary and their daughters (sons had died) to Zion in the spring of 1856.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis family joined others in Liverpool and sailed under Dan Jones\u2019 watchful care in the ship SAMUEL CURLING. This group arrived in Council Bluff via Boston and outfitted as the third handcart company under the direction of Edward Bunker, leaving in June of 1856, just ahead of the ill-fated Martin and Willis companies.\n</p>\n<p>\nPricilla Merriman Evans was a member of that company and recorded the following: \u201ca handcart for each family. Each handcart carried about 100 pounds of flour and when that was gone we got more from the wagon. (five mule teams hauled tents and flour in wagons) carried coffee and bacon which was soon gone. .. about three hundred Welsh Saints.. about a dozen in our tent.. allowed to bring but 17 pound of baggage and clothing.. the sick were pulled on the carts, no one could ride in the wagons.. we had no snow and the weather was quite pleasant.. had to leave clothes and other possessions in the campground in Iowa to be put in the storehouse and later brought to the valley. The storehouse burned down.. settlers along the way made fun of us...\u201d But on they trudged to Zion, arriving 2 October 1856 about five months after leaving Council Bluff.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn, Mary and their daughters settled in Millcreek in the vicinity of the present 33rd South and 7th East. The first record of them in the valley is the 1860 Greater Salt Lake census. John is listed as a farmer with about $50 worth of personal estate, age 42, Mary age 44, Ann 17, Jane 15.  Their eldest daughter, Elizabeth had already in December of 1856, became the young fourth wife of an older Scottish convert who had traveled in the same handcart company. Sarah had left to find work in South Willow Creek. She walked about 12 miles along the old pioneer road that led to Willowcreek. Being dead tired she stopped at the pioneer cabin of Perry Fitzgeralds\u2019. He took her in and gave her work. Sarah married Perry Fitzgerald\u2019s son John, 17 Feb. 1858. With these exceptions, all of John Williams family remained in Millcreek. Ann and her sister Jane married a young English neighbor of theirs, Henry Rhodes, on the same day, 13 January 1866. Both died of child birth. Ann in 1871 after having five children, and Jane in 1880 after having seven children.  (Grandma Smith tells in her autobiographical sketch that she and Heber A stopped in to see her Williams grandparents in Feb. 1880 while returning from their marriage at the endowment house.  Her grandfather John Williams had recently gone to Salt Lake for a coffin in which to bury his daughter (this must have been Jane) and had his leg broken by a drunken teamster.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe ward history of Millcreek does not mention John or Mary Williams, nor does his name appear as participating in any official capacity. His baptism is recorded as the 15 Feb. 1870. This may or may not have been the first baptism for John, but does appear to be so since within five months he and Mary receive their endowments (after being in the valley about 14 years) and they were sealed in the Endowment House. At the same time John is sealed to his wife\u2019s two deceased sisters, Elizabeth and Sarah.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn remained monogamous when all about him was polygamy. Why? Mary did some proxy work at the Salt Lake Temple in company with her Parry relatives, but John\u2019s name is not there.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn\u2019s death is recorded in the Newspaper of the week of 23 Jan. 1891. His cause of death was perhaps a stroke, \u201cparalysis\u201d according to the obituary. He died at 75 year of age. The funeral was held in the Millcreek schoolhouse on the 25th. The speakers included two Welsh men, Elias Morris and Joseph Hyrum Parry. His wife Mary lived three years longer, then died of an accidental fall in which she broke her thigh. She was 80 years, 5 months and 13 days old.

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nLIFE HISTORY OF ENOS CURTIS<br />\n(As told by Brother Harward, his grandson)\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis was born in Holland, October 9th, 1783. He had a sister about two years younger than himself, whose name was Ruth. One night when Enos was about four years of age, his father came home from his work as usual and upon entering the house his wife met him with the statement, \"Enos is yours and Ruth is mine.\" A quarrel followed and finally the father picked Enos up and left the home. His father then took him to the home of a good woman who cared for him until he was fourteen years of age.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of fourteen years his father took him and bound him out as an apprentice to learn the carpenter trade. He was bound out for seven years.  The man was very cruel to Enos and made him work very hard. He had been with this man only about three or four years when he heard of a ship that was coming to America so he decided to run away and try to get passage on this ship. He went to the Captain and asked if he might work as a servant on the ship to earn his passage. The Captain asked him questions concerning his life and people. When he related his story the Captain told him if he desired, to be there at a certain hour the following day and he could go to America. He was at the dock at the appointed hour the following day with all his personal belongings tied up in a red handerchief.  When the ship reached America the Captain offered to let Enos remain with the ship and work for them. He had served them well and they had become very fond of him, but he would not stay.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos was the only one of his family, so far as he knew, that ever came to America. He never heard of his mother or father after he left Holland.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe later married Ruth Franklin. Her father and two brothers were in the Revolutionary War under George Washington and were all three killed in this war.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis was one of the first to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints after it was organized by Joseph Smith. He and Brother Jebediah Colton? (Zebedee Coltrin) were called on a mission in the vicinity where Brigham Young lived. They tacked up posters that they were holding meeting at a certain place. Brigham Young came to this meeting and heard them tell of this new religion and was favorably impressed. After the meeting he hurried to his home, where he had left his wife very ill at the time. He went to his room and knelt in prayer and asked the Lord if this religion was true to send these elders to his home that he might have them administer to his wife. He desired this as a testimony of the divinity of this new religion. These missionaries did come that way and as they were passing they were first impressed with the tidyness of the yards. They remarked that the man that lived there must have a lot of pride. They were next impressed to go in. Brigham Young was watching them and when they knocked he opened the door and welcomed them in. He told them how he had prayed that they would come to his home and administer to his wife that she might be healed. They asked him if he believed that she could be healed through their administration and he told them he did. They did administer to her and she was restored to her health. This was the first time Brigham Young had heard the Restored Gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the Saints started west, Enos Curtis and his wife, Ruth Franklin, started with one of the companies, but Ruth Franklin died at the Bluffs and was buried there. Enos Curtis came on to Utah and settled in Springville.  While here he became acquainted with Tammy Durfee Miner. She was the sister of Jabez Durfee and had been married to a man by the name of Miner, who had died. Enos Curtis married Tammy Miner and they had three girls, Clarissa, Malinda, and Melia. Enos Curtis later died and was buried in Springville.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis kept a diary of his life, but after his death the Miner boys used it for smoking paper and thus destroyed this valuable record.\n</p>\n<p>\nP.S. Grandpa Harward's memory is surely keen and he relates so many incidents that has witnessed and also that he has heard others relate, in such a clear, concise way that one cannot help believing they are true. I have heard him relate incidents at different times, with long intervals between, and the facts are always the same.  (Lue Cutis Lazenby)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

She was well built physically, well proportioned as she weighed about 200 pounds. She possessed wonderful auburn hair, and took pride in it, and in a manner in which it was to be dressed. She always had it in ringlets and curls all about her head. She did it so until after her 4th child was born.  Then styles changed and she dressed it in the coming mode.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was gentle and mild having a feeling she could not be unkind with any of her children even to correct them. She was loving, affectionate and generous.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was regretable that she passed away enroute to Salt Lake City as founding anew home and rearing the children in a new country, with the customs and conditions so different needed a mother and her care. The young women just budding into womanhood needed the advice and love of a thoughtful mother. This was denied them as well as the boys who were very young, especially some of them. However, the new wife, Caroline Woodhall, did her best as she saw it. She had never been a mother and had not experienced a mother's love and anxious moments. She tried to do her part by these children who lost their mother out in the wilds of America.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe wild grass waves, and the wild sighs mournfully over the graves of a wonderful Mother and her 2 daughters who shall have those resting spots until the trump shall sound and the resurrection of the just and true shall be consummated.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June 1852, Joseph Howard, son James and daughter Emma all journeyed to St. George, Utah, and did the temple work, including all ordinances for Ann Shelton Howard.\n</p>\n<p>\nCaroline Richards Woodall Howard\n</p>\n<p>\nDied March 3, 1912, Layton, Utah when she was 83 years old at the home of her step daughter, Emma Corbridge.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer funeral was held in South Bountiful, Utah, at the ward chapel.

The place is New Market, Flintshire, North Wales. A lovely little bundle of humanity had opened new eyes that morning upon a new world; life had begun for another of God's daughters - Sarah Ann Williams. The baby grew as all babies do and soon became a favorite of the family, especially of her grandfather Williams, who used to carry her about on his shoulders or give her a small coin when her flying feet would carry her to meet him when he came through the gate.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer father John Williams, was one of the successful farmers of the town, receiving many prizes at the county fair for his fine horses and geese and cattle. He was considered the man who could plow the straightest furrow, and left the most grain, in all the country round about. Being over six feet tall and very strong, he could carry five hundred pounds of wheat up his granary steps and place it in the bins. He was loved and respected by all his neighbors, and his family was his chief pride and joy.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach child had work to do. With butter to be churned, cheese to be made, cows to be milked, the animals to be fed, it was a busy household. It fell to Sarah's lot to tend the geese. There were no fences between the farms, and it required constant attention to keep the geese out of the grain fields and along the right paths. They were taken out in the morning to the ponds and feeding grounds and brought back to their pens at night. This life went on for the Williams Father, Mother, four girls and one son, until the death of the only boy, which brought sorrow and grief into the home, but time heals all wounds, and gradually life became happy again.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen when Sarah was about twelve years of age some strange men from a foreign land came to the village of New Market. They were ministers of a new Gospel - missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - \"Mormons\"! Meetings were held, interest among the people was aroused, and in spite of the opposition, in the course of time many people were converted and baptized. Among them was Mary Williams and her daughters. They longed to migrate with others to Zion -- to the Valleys of the Mountains -- out in Utah, so when Sarah Williams was about 15 years old her father sold his fine horses, cattle, geese and other belongings and bought tickets for the voyage to America. The time of parting was a sad, tearful experience. Sarah's Grandfather Williams said goodbye before they left for the seaport. He felt their loss so keenly that he didn't want to see them leave the coast of Wales for the long, long journey across the ocean. He knew he would never see them again, so it was with great sorrow in his heart that he said farewell.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe journey was anything but pleasant. The ocean was choppy and rough, the sailing vessel was not the best, and for days at a time when adverse winds blew they would not make any headway at all.  Added to the other hardships of the voyage such as sea-sickness, cold and exposure, came scarlet fever, and Sarah was the one who took it in the most severe form. For days she hovered near the brink of the great beyond. Everyone except her mother gave her up for dead, but the faith of her mother never waivered, and though very weak when they finally reached Boston, she was able to walk down the gang-plank, with the aid of her father and mother. They were six weeks on the ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy train they traveled from New York to Iowa City, Iowa, where they formed in companies to make the trek to the mountains.  They made, or bought, handcarts in which they put their provisions for their walk across the plains. Traveling light, they sometimes didn't have sufficient provisions, but for a time they passed farm houses where supplies could be bought. Hardships and rationing began when the last farm house was passed. When it rained the handcarts would have to be pushed or pulled through mud ankle-deep.  At other times dust and sand combined to make the miles traveled in one day very few indeed. At night when the campfires were lighted, probably a violin could be heard, then someone would sing some Welsh songs, and soon some weak child or babe would be left in a grave beside the way, with perhaps only a few rocks to mark the resting place.\n</p>\n<p>\nOften Sarah and the girls her age were called upon to gather buffalo chips to make fires. It was on one of these assignments that Sarah saw her first Indian, clad only in a loin cloth and carrying a rifle. He calmly stalked over the brow of a hill and was lost to view.  Sarah made the statement that although he was the first Indian she saw, he wasn't the last one!\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter entering the bounds of Wyoming their water gave out.  Teams and wagons were sent back for more, but days lapsed before they returned and the thirst of the travelers became acute. Tongues were swollen, eyes became bloodshot and the heat of the summer sun beat mercilessly down upon the suffering saints. In speaking of this harrowing experience later Sarah said: \"I have seen strong men fall upon the ground, tongues and throats so swollen that they could not speak, almost to the point of death, from the lack of water; and I have seen women who were nursing babies wet their husbands' lips with milk from their breasts to help keep them alive until the water came. When water did come the thirst of some was so great that they drank too much and died as the result.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe summer was passing, and they kept walking, walking, pushing and pulling. More than one woman had lost her husband on the way, so two women would help each other over the trail and up and down the hills. So the handcart company went on. Many times they were stopped by herds of buffalo passing. Buffalo meat helped out with their food problems. Sometimes at night, when it rained and the wind blew, everyone would be required to hold their tents to keep them from blowing over; many provisions were drenched or lost, and the people would suffer exceedingly. Sickness and death were often the result.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe journey ended when the company arrived in Salt Lake City October 2, 1856. The Williams' spent the first winter in a dugout in Salt Lake City. Later the family moved to 33rd South (formerly known as 14th South). Sarah at this time started to look for work to help out financially at home. She walked from Millcreek (about 33rd South) and came to what is now the Draper-Riverton Crossroad. She gives it as follows: \"It seemed to me that a voice told me to take the road to Willow Creek, so I did and came to the home of Perry Fitzgerald where I obtained employment and had all the milk I wanted to drink. It was there I met John Fitzgerald, the oldest son of Perry, and after a short courtship we were married in the old Endowment House in Salt Lake City February 17, 1858, by Daniel H.  Wells.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe rest of the history is written by Sarah Jane Fitzgerald Smith, a daughter.\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon the arrival of Johnston's army Sarah moved to Payson with the Fitzgerald family. Her husband remained in Salt Lake Valley to guard the property and otherwise serve those in authority.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer married life was filled with all the hardships, privations and dangers of pioneer life. On one occasion she barely escaped being scalped by an angry Indian.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile bringing some immigrants to Utah her husband brought her a cook stove. She was one of the first in Draper to have such a valued treasure. She washed, corded and spun many pounds of wool to provide clothes for her family.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was a common practice in the early days for those who attended the dancing parties to come to her home for lunch during\n</p>\n<p>\nthe intermission. She became known for the excellent meals she provided. In those days dances began at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and lasted until midnight.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was the mother of nine daughters and two sons. Her life was truly one of service and loving tenderness, never forgetting the poor and waiting on the sick. She possessed nobility of soul, sweetness of disposition, firmness of purpose and rare judgment in the discernment of right and wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe served her church for 40 years as a Relief Society worker, and she was always liberal in her donations to the cause of righteousness. She has 47 grand children, 60 great grand children, 11 great great grand children at the time of this writing - Jan. 8, 1942. In the family of one of her daughters three sons are bishops, five of her grandsons and great grandsons and one grand daughter have been on missions.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was left a widow in 1892 with 6 of her 11 children at home. Courage never failed her. Her patriarchal blessing said that she would remain here as long as life was sweet. On February 24, 1917 she asked her grandson, Alma F. Smith, whom she loved, to dedicated her to the Lord, and soon after passed peacefully away.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer life was a real conversion for eternal happiness. Her memory is cherished by her family and grandchildren.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

He was the son of Robert Flint and Ann Wilson Poll. His father was a cabinet-maker. Grandfather at the early age of eight began learning his father's trade.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandmother was born and reared in Wymondham, a thrifty little town a few miles southwest of Norwich. Her birthday was June 29, 1823. Her parents were John and Elizabeth Minns Long. They kept a public house and butcher shop. Grandmother was a butcher and an efficient meat cutter.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and Grandmother made their home in Lowestoft, and old, old town in the northern part of Suffolk near the salt marshes along the eastern coast of England. This town was originally inhabited by the Danes who named it Lowestoft, meaning the low place to the east.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandmother liked Lowestoft, and was very happy there until grandfather began drinking too much. \"'alf and 'alf\" and a bit of rum, but grandmother like the devoted wife she always was, made it a point to meet him each night after work at Bowling Green and walked home with him, thus avoiding the grog shops.\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth their first child was born and died at Lowestoft, then they moved to Wymondham where William John and Ann Marie were born. Later they moved to Great Ellenford and Fredrick Robert was born there.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time Grandfather and Grandmother after thoroughly investigating the principles of Mormonism as taught by the L.D. S.  Missionaries, joined the Church and were baptized December 15, 1848.  At that time all converts were urged to come to Utah and settle among the saints. Grandfather and Grandmother were very anxious, but because of their financial condition, they were unable to make the journey, so they lived their religion and attended Church services in Norwich.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 1852 Granfather's friend Robert T. Neslen, who was very well to do, offered to pay their emigration expenses for the whole Poll family if Grandfather would build for him (Neslen) in Salt Lake City. Grandfather gladly accepted the offer and preparation for the trip were made. Soon after the joyous Yuletide, they said \"Goodbye\" to their many loved ones and were on their way. At the dock there was some difficulty with the presiding Elder of the Company, Jacob Gates, over Grandfather bringing his chest of tools. They sailed from Liverpool on the ship Golconda, January 23, and arrived in New Orleans on March 26, 1853.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder the direction of John Brown, Emigration Agent at New Orleans, they transhipped and continued up the Mississippi River to Keokuk, Iowa, a place which had been selected as the outfitting post for the Saints crossing the plains that year. They stayed in Keokuk a few weeks where they obtained oxen and wagons, food supplies and equipment necessary for the trip westward which they began in the latter part of May. One day they came a large stream which they had to cross on a raft. Elder Gates said, \"well, Brother Poll, will you get your tools and help build a raft?\" Grandfather was delighted to say, \"If you had your way, I would not have had any tools.\" .\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir company suffered all manner of hardships incidental to life on the Great Plains and arrived in Salt Lake City in September. Grandfather soon began work on the house for his friend, Neslen (Nelsen)\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and Grandmother made their home upon the hill in the 20th Ward. They did not have much of a house and like many other people at that time they used their covered wagon box for a bedroom. On { August 4, 1854, Elizabeth Jennette, their !  third daughter was born. when she was five | &amp; days old a dreadful rainstorm washed the \u2018 wagon box with it's occupants down on the 8th ward square, the block on which the City and County Building now stands, but no further damage was done. Three other daughters, Martha Ann, Mary Ann and Alice Eliza were born while they lived in the 20th ward.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and family were among the families that were called by President Brigham Young to go south and settle the country known as Dixie. This was a five-year mission and Grandfather's duty August 1873 was to make furniture.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1861, the Poll family located on a small acreage in the Grafton Ward near the Virgin River. They lived in one adobe room.  Grandfather enclosed the lot with a woven willow fence about 2 1/2 or 3 feet high. Part of the lot near the front of the house was used as a calf pasture. One day the children were playing in this little pasture when Grandmother saw a panther leap over the low fence and take a calf. She was always thankful that it was a calf instead of one of the children.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe people in Utah's Dixie had a bad year in 1865. The Country suffered from a heavy drought. Food stuff was very, very scarce and people in some places suffered from hunger.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn one occasion, when Grandmother had used the last of her flour in making a few precious biscuits which she had baking in a bake oven, a tall distinguished-looking man, exceptionally well dressed in a dark suit of clothes, came to the door and asked for bread. She told him if he would wait until the bread was done she would divide it with him. He waited and when she gave him the bread he blessed her and told her she would never want for bread. He walked down the path as far as the gate. There was nothing to obstruct the view except \u2014 the low willow fence. Grandmother and the children looked for him but he had completely vanished. She always said he was one of the Three Nephites. About this time Grandfather was awfully worried.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe did not know what to do to provide bread for his family, and being a man of great faith, he made it a matter of prayer. He was inspired to go down to the Virgin River, cut &amp;cottonwood trees and burn them, take the ashes to Toquerville where he would get flour. He followed this inspiration and to his satisfaction he exchanged a sack of ashes for a sack of flour with the people there who were using ashes for making soap in their new soap factory. He returned home with bread stuff for his thankful family. Grandfather and Grandmother were blessed while they lived in Grafton by the arrival of two more children, Harriet and Charles Henry. A great sorrow came into their lifes when their daughter Maria, wife of Joseph Gibson, died-leaving him and two children.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir mission was completed in 1866. Grandfather and his family left the Dixie country and returned to Salt Lake City. They made their home in the 10th Ward. Their house was two large rooms on the corner of 4th South and 10th East. Their son Joseph was born there.  In the summer of 1869 they sold this little home and moved into a comfortable adobe house on the corner of 4th South and 9th East.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather worked a number of years making furniture for the Dinwoodey Furniture Company. Then for some time he worked on the Salt Lake Temple. His wages being partly cash and partly commodities from the Church Tithing Office.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time the Poll family was deeply grieved by the death of the eldest son and brother William J., who left a wife Louise Strong Poll and two small children.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir three elder girls of the family had a hat shop on the corner of Grandfather's lot where they prepared straw, braided it, made hats and sold them. After the girls were married Grandfather used the shop as a carpenter shop. During this time he became very seriously ill and for sometime he was unable to work.\n</p>\n<p>\nLater on through Grandmothers influence he opened a Meat Market in the old carpenters shop where he and Grandmother worked together.  After the children were married grandfather sold the home and Meat Market and moved into a little house just around the corner on 9th East. Like all her homes, Grandmother kept it very cozy and homey, and one of the greatest joys of our lives was to visit there.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe affectionate welcome and hospitable influence of the home was unsurpassed. It was here in the evening of November 3, 1892, that Grandfather and Grandmother celebrated their Golden Wedding.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were happy and proud to greet such a large gathering of their children and Grandchildren. All enjoyed a lovely dinner and an extemporaneous program. A gold headed cane and a gold headed umbrella with suitable inscriptions engraved therein was presented to the elderly couple who cherished these gifts as long as they lived. Years before Grandfather laid off the liquor and tobacco habits.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe and Grandmother were contended and happy. Their home life was simple and pleasant. They were prosperous in business, active in Church affairs, and sincere in their religious belief. In later life they did some temple work.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather died November 7, 1895. Funeral services were held Sunday, November 10th in the 10th Ward Chapel and he was buried in the City Cemetery. Dear little brokenhearted Grandmother just could not live in the old home without Grandfather, so she broke up house keeping and lived with one of her daughters for the balance of her life. Another sorrow came into her life when her daughter Jennette passed away leaving her husband Joseph Earl and a large family. Grandmother died February 19, 1903 at the home of her daughter Harriet in South Weber. After her funeral services in Salt Lake in the 10th ward Chapel she was laid to rest by the side of Grandfather. At this time June 15, 1940 there are 303 living descendants.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll credit for this sketch can be given to Lizzie Poll Berrett and Ida Berrett Poll.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The family was driven by mobs into Far West; mobs placed guards in front of their dooryard to prevent Mormons from going in and out of town. Ward would crawl through a crack between the logs in the back of the house to escape the guards.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family moved to Nauvoo where he was baptized in the font of the Nauvoo Temple. He saw the Prophet Joseph Smith many times--saw him playing and wrestling, dressed in his military uniform, drilling the legion, preaching, and in disguise to fool his enemies. One day Ward was sent to the Smith home on an errand and the Prophet insisted that Ward sit and eat breakfast with him. He stood by the side of the road when the bodies of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were being brought back from Carthage.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen he was fourteen, he drove a team of two yoke of oxen and one yoke of cows across the plains. When his father was called on a mission to France, the responsibility of providing for the family was placed upon Ward. At the age of nineteen, he was married to Elizabeth Still by Brigham Young.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn April conference of 1854 he was called on a mission to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). When he returned, his wife was very ill and died shortly after. He soon married Laura Cravath, Elizabeth's best friend. In 1870, he moved the family to Kamas where he and Laura worked with other families in the manufacturing of cheese. He was called on a second mission to the Sandwich Islands. Even while on his mission, he was appointed second counselor in the Summit Stake presidency, a position he held for twenty--two years. In 1884 he lost the bottom part of his right arm in a machinery accident. He learned to write with his left hand, build houses, break horses, and do every kind of farm work in spite of the handicap.\n</p>\n<p>\nLaura's parents joined the church when she was very young and moved to Nauvoo. When she was four years old her father died of malaria while helping clear the swamps. She was only ten years old when she and her thrice-widowed mother, two sisters and baby brother came across the trail to Utah. She helped drive the team of oxen.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs she reached maturity, she was very attractive, and received forty proposals to enter into polygamy. She resolved never to marry but to stay with her mother and take care of her. Her dearest friend Elizabeth was married to Ward Pack, who was on a mission. She said to Laura, \"Laura, don't marry until Ward comes home, then marry him for I would rather share him with you than anyone else. \" Three months after Elizabeth died, Ward and she were married by Heber C. Kimball. Her wedding dress was a new soft, brown-checked gingham.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe learned to card wool, spin it, dye it and weave it into cloth. She made her husband a suit from raw wool. They lived in Kamas for thirty- eight years. They had a large log room with dirt floor and a lean-to for a kitchen. Each spring she white-washed the log walls and wove 35 yards of bright, striped rag carpet which she fastened to the earth with wooden pegs.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe loved to read and found time to read in the evening doing the churning, sitting with a book in one hand and working the dasher up and down with the other. She wrote poetry. She was the mother of eleven children; her first daughter died while Ward was serving in the Sandwich Islands. When her last child was a few days old, her husband's plural wife died and left a family of four which she took into her home. About a month later, her sister-in-law passed away and left a tiny baby which Laura nursed and cared for with her own baby. A few years later, her husband's sister died in childbirth and she took the young baby and mothered it for nine months at which time it died. After her large family was grown, a younger plural wife died and left two boys, these she also took into her home and reared and mothered them. These children loved and honored her all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter her husband, and two grown sons died, she moved to Salt Lake City to be near her children.. She spent these last years doing Temple work which gave her much joy and happiness.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource text\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nWilliam and Margaret Hood Easton<br />\nAs told by Beatrice Easton Alleman\n</p>\n<p>\nOur family consisted of six boys and five girls: William, Mary, Alex, Janet, Peter, Viola, Andrew, Franklin, Anne, Beatrice and Thomas.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe lived in several mining towns as Papa was a fir-boss in the coal mines. My earliest memories were of Glencoe Wyoming. I was born is Elkol, a short way from Glencoe. The mines in both of these towns have been closed for many years.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we lived in Glencoe all eleven children were home and it was a very noisy and busy household. Everyone was expected to work as soon as they were old enough.\n</p>\n<p>\nI remember well, as if it were yesterday, the day Thomas was born. It was a busy Christmas night at our house, but early Christmas morning when I ran into the living room a bare Christmas tree stood in the comer and Santa Clause hadn\u2019t come except to bring us a new baby brother. We were all very happy and all of his life he brought love and happiness into our lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother incident I remember about Glencoe is what happened to Franklin. in the town there was a big store that was owned by the minning company and a horse drawn wagon would come around to all to the houses in the morning to take our grocery order and then deliver them in the afternoon. As the wagon was driving away one day from our house, Franklin caught hold of the back of the wagon to take a ride. The driver was a big man and he stopped his wagon and grabbed hold of Franklin and shook him and said, \u201cIf you ever do that again I'll grease your head and swallow you whole.\u201d Franklin was so frightened he fainted with a heart attack and was never well again. Later we moved to Cumberland where he passed away. When no one was looking, I went into the dark bedroom where Franklin was and saw that he was dressed in a suit and packed in ice in a tub that was dark green and shaped like our bath tubs today. We stayed a long time in Cumberland and a lot of my memories are of that period.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy now William was married to Eula, Alex married Rose, Viola married Leon Rollins and Mary had married Lee Hamblin and had given birth to Lorene. Mary was an angel but not very strong and so when Lorene was born she didn\u2019t have enough milk to nurse her. I am fourteen months older than Lorene and mama was still nursing me (they did that in those days) so she nursed Lorene also. I have always thought that it is why we are more like sisters than aunt and niece.\n</p>\n<p>\nLater Janet married Frank Stones who was a widower with an eight year old daughter. Before Janet married, she worked as a house keeper for several families, and also for a taylor. She was a fine seamstress, as were all of my sisters.\n</p>\n<p>\nMary and Lee lived in Lyman Wyoming because that is where Lee\u2019s family was.  After Viola married she and Leon also lived in Lyman.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen our family was in Cumberland, we had a big house and lots of company.  There was also a lot of singing and dancing and wonderful food and goodies. My brothers and sisters made wonderful candy of every kind \u2014 chocolates, marshmallows, divinity etc.. One day mama went to the store and saw there a beautiful girl talking to the clerk. She was crying and mama overheard her say she was the new school teacher from Evanston and was looking for someplace to get a room. The clerk told her there was not a hotel in town and he didn\u2019t know of any place that could accommodate her.  Mama could see how frightened the girl was and walked over and put her arms around her and said \u201cI believe I was sent up here to help a girl in trouble.\u201d Her name was Janet Crawford and after mama introduced herself she told the girl that she had a daughter with the name of Janet and if she was willing she could come to our home and share our Janets bedroom. Janet C. fit right in and was with us for two years.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne night my sisters and brothers were making marshmallow, the extract they use was lemon. The next day when mama went to use her eye drops the bottle was empty the kids had used the wrong bottle to flavor the candy and everyone declared they had come down with sore eyes.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had an organ and some of my sisters could cord. Janet Crawford could play and it was fun to watch everyone sing and dance.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew was giving my parents a hard time when he was about fourteen years old. He would go out and pick up bum lambs. We had a big barn at one end of our yard and Andrew kept the lambs there at night. One day he told Thomas and myself that we had to watch his lambs while he put them out to graze and that we could sit in his red wagon if we were good. Believe me we weren't thrilled but were afraid to cross him as we were threatened with disaster. We were near tears by late afternoon when Andrew returned. Towards fall when the nights became cold Andrew made the lambs burlap covers to keep them warm but a sad thing happened, they all strangled in the covers during the night. He really thought a lot of those lambs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndrew used to keep a diary which really should have been saved it was very funny. We had a picture show house in town that could only show one reel at a time so while they changed the reel the lights were turned on sisters and their friends would read Andrew\u2019s diary and nearly die laughing. Papa always gave Andy a curfew when he went out at night with the warning that if he didn\u2019t make it home on time he would be locked out. Andrew solved this problem my making sure one of the windows would be unlocked before he left.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy brothers all had bad tempers and so there was a lot of noise and arguments in our house. One time they went out in the back yard and were going to shoot each other. They counted the customary ten and as they turned around with their guns drawn there stood Papa between them. He removed the pistols, gave them a good scolding and probably never gave the guns back.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur sister Annie died from meningitis when she was only two years old. Peter and Alex played baseball with Alex as the pitcher and Peter the catcher. They were very good and played all of the towns in our area until the leagues began to play on Sundays.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter living in Cumberland our family moved to Sublet a town a few miles above Kemmerer. While we were there Mama went to take care of Janet when her first son Frank Jr. was born. Thomas went with Mama and I was left in charge of cleaning and cooking for Papa and Andrew. After two weeks Frank Sr. brought them home and I made a lovely dinner of home made bread, a roast and cake. Uncle Frank always said that fresh bread was the best bread he had ever eaten and I believed him.\n</p>\n<p>\nLater we moved to Evanston and were there for a long time. Our house was a large two story home and while we lived there Papa was called on a mission to Scotland. He was gone for 26 months and he and another elder brother Starkey traveled around Europe before coming home. Peter was supposed to look after the family while Papa was on his mission, but was going with Harriet Turner and they were married. Andrew had to quit school and take a job at the railroad yards. During this time he took correspondence courses and received his high school diploma. When Andy moved to Salt Lake City he took night school and majored in history and minning and received degrees in both these areas. He worked hard and had some lean years and finally became our families only millionaire. Andrew married Isabel Mills an adorable, wonderful girl.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring World War I, Violas\u2019 husband Leon was drafted and because she was expecting their first child she came to live with us in Evanston. After a few months a beautiful baby girl named Myrtle was born. We were all thrilled and loved her. When Leon came home from the war they moved back to Lyman.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven though we all enjoyed our big house in Evanston, it was sold and we moved to a smaller one as there was only Papa, mama, Andrew, Thomas and myself still at home. Many memoral things happened in that house. By now Papa no longer worked for the mines, but on the highway. He became very brown from being in the sun and one Sunday as he was shaving to get ready for Sunday school, his razor slipped and cut off one side of his mustache. He was so angry as he shaved off the rest of it.  This left a very white upper lip. He looked so funny as he finished getting ready. When he walked into church his arms folded there was a look on his face that said he dared anyone to make a remark.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile we were in the small house a sad thing happened, Thomas and I came down with the small pox. In those days when you had a communicable disease you were quarantined and no one could go in or out. Neighbors and our family saw to our needs by leaving necessary things on the porch. When Mama became very ill with a high fever the doctor took some of the matter from under one of Thomas scabs and vaccinated her with it. That kept the pox on the inside and she didn\u2019t break out but was very sick and only had Thomas and I with her. At this bad time, to make matters worse word came that our brother William had passed away. Papa went to Cumberland to see him buried and poor Mama just laid on her bed and cried. William had the flu and pneumonia and the first day he was out of bed and dressed his wife Eula came home from a visit to see her mother who was very ill. When she came in the house she was crying and when William asked her what was the matter she told him her mother had just died. William went into the bedroom in shock and died of a heart attack. Just two weeks later Eula gave birth to their third child a little boy. Their children were Grenith, Jack, and now Billy.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally all of us recovered and life returned to normal. Another thing that happened in our dinning room that was just off the kitchen, were seated at the huge table and Papa was having trouble opening one of Mama's homemade bottles of rootbeer. Peter stood up and said he could open it and Papa handed it to him.  Unfortunately he had the bottle tipped in Papas\u2019 direction. The cap came off with one tug, by this time the bottle had been shook up, and the foam poured out hitting Papa in the face and down his clothes. He was furious saying Peter did it on purpose and ordered him from the house. No matter what Peter said Papa yelled \u201cGet out\u201d. Well Peter didn\u2019t get any supper that night. It was really very funny but Papa just couldn\u2019t see the humor.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time I was thirteen years old and in the 7\" grade in Evanston. There were three seventh grades and I had the highest marks in math, and spelling, but times have changed and spelling seems to be a problem now.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time Mama was feeling sick and the Evanston doctor sent her to Salt Lake where they operated on her and found cancer of the uterus. The cancer had spread throughout her body and so they sewed her up and sent her home to die. She lived in pain and agony for some time and when I would give her a sponge bathe every day she would faint several times. After awhile, I got used to it and wasn't frightened. I gave the bath with the window open and a dipper of water by the bed so I could sit her up and give her a drink. When the end of her suffering stopped all of the family were with her. We all loved our mother very much. She was the dearest kindess person on the face of the earth. Her funeral was the largest one I have ever seen, the church was full and people stood as much as a block away. \u201cAunt Maggie\u201d as she was known, was missed by everyone.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur lives changed drastically. I went to Lyman to live with Mary and attended the eighth grade with Lorene. They were so good to me and treated me like their own daughter. At the end of that year, I returned to live with Papa in Frontier and things were very different from when Mama was there. We went to church and joined in all the activities. I spent that year home and went to the nineth grade in Kemmere. At this time Papa began going with a woman named Mrs. Dean, who had been a widow for years and a few months later were married in one of the temples. I have forgotten which one.  Thomas lived with them, but I went back to Lyman for my sophomore and juniors.  Lorene and I had classes together and spent most of our other hours together. Our lives were full of singing, dancing, and dating. We were like sisters and it was one of the best times of my life.\n</p>\n<p>\nPapa was having trouble with his new wife because she wanted to be the boss and you can imagine Papa wouldn\u2019t allow that. One day while he was at work one of her sons from Evanston came get her and they took everything. All of Mamas\u2019 lovely dishes, silverware, bedspreads, everything was gone. They were then divorced and Papa was alone again. He was then living in Susie, another small minning town. Andrew and Isabell lived in an apartment in the house Thomas and Papa lived in. During this time Andrew and Isabell had a beautiful son they named Donald and we all had such fun with him.\n</p>\n<p>\nI returned home from Lyman and spent the next year there and graduated from Kemmerer High School in 1928.\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery year when the University of Wyoming had spring break, all of the highschools of the state would use their facilities. We stayed in the dorms and ate at the cafeteria. There were basketball teams, voice readings, debates, commercial studies, and all other aspects of highschool studies that we could compete in. It was a lovely experience. Mrs. Harris was the chaperone for the girl contestants. My freshman year in Lyman I had entered the contest for reading and was chosen to represent the school at Laramie. Then the next year, when I was a junior, I entered for debate and won the trip to the \u201cU\u201d. Ididn\u2019t place, but had a wonderful time. My senior year, at Kemmerer, I tried out for voice and was again chosen. Although there was to be only one contestant form each school, Evanston sent two, a boy and a girl who had trained voices. They place first and second while I took third. All my friends at our school thought I should have had first. It was a busy year, as I also had the lead in our Senior class play. The school operetta practices were at the same time and said I couldn\u2019t be in it, but was called to the principals office and he gave me no choice, they needed me. They gave me three solos from the lead role. I was a cheer leader for three years and won the first letter ever given to a girl at Kemmerer High School. It was the school colors, a red and black megaphone. I wore it on my white sweater with a pair of white corduroy bell bottom pants for cheering.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn the train to Laramie, Norval and I made our first date, even though we had known each other since we were freshman we had never clicked before. This was in March 1928. Norval was a wonderful athlete in all sports but outstanding in football and basketball. He was tall dark and handsome and when I introduced him to Papa they liked each other right away.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time it was getting hard for me to get to school, so Papa asked Aunt Miriha and Uncle Andrew to take me to live with them during the week as there was a school bus would pick up the kids who lived in Oakley. I did not like Aunt Miriha and she was anything but nice to me. Of course she charged Papa for my room and board but seemed to resent me. She didn\u2019t like me going out on dates and would get after me.  The girls were sorry for me and treated me good. That year finally passed and I graduated. Summer came and passed as all summers do with trips and dates. Norval went to Cheyenne for an operation on his lip that had been badly cut when he was a child. After a couple of weeks he came back and brought me a diamond ring and asked me to marry him. I often teased him by saying I only said \u201cyes\u201d to get the ring. We made our plans to get married on the 4\u2122 of October, 1928. In the fall I went to Lyman and Mary made me some lovely dresses. One was a beautiful colored silk with a pleated skirt. Norval came to Lyman to take me home. We sat in the rumble seat and did a lot of hugging and kissing. On Oct 4\" Papa and Mother Alleman went with us to get our marriage license to sign for us because we were not yet twenty one. All of the family on both sides were there and after the wedding my sisters made a delicious dinner and set a beautiful table with our best china and silverware. There were even beautiful flowers.  We were married in Janets home and Pete, who was a member of the bishopric, preformed the ceremony. Mel Bradshaw was our best man and Narvals mother as the matron of honor. Mel helped Narval get ready for the wedding and make ice cream for the refreshments. Earlier they had taken me down town to get my hair done and when I was through no one came for me like they were supposed to. I walked home and found those two having fun with the ice cream. After every thing was ready I came in on Papas\u2019 arm and he gave me away. When the ceremony was over the little kids had a chiveree, they pounded on pans until we gave them dimes to stop. We were then given a ride in baby buggies and when Narvals broke down they put him in a red wagon and were given a fast ride down to Peters\u2019 Barber Shop where we each were given a mud pack. All of my family stayed over night and we had our breakfast together at Janets again. After a nice visit, Narval and I went to Salt Lake for a Honeymoon. We stayed with Lorene and Mel Bradshaw, saw our first color talking movie and Narval bought me a beautiful dress.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we settled down we lived in a house next to Mother Allemans\u2019. We had only been married about six weeks, when Uncle Tom Hood called on the phone and told us Papa was very sick and would like us to come to Susie where he still lived. We found him very ill with a sever cough and high fever. We doctored him with vicks rubs, aspirin, and hot lemonade. Papa was so happy to have us there. We stayed all night and since the next day was Thanksgiving we took him to Kemmerer and Mother Allemans house for dinner but he couldn\u2019t eat so Mother Alleman made him a hot drink out of dandelion wine. We were worried and called Dr. Newman, our friend and family doctor for many years, to come to the house and examine him. It proved to be pneumonia and he needed to go to the hospital. Narval and I stayed with him all day and night.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere just wasn't the medicines to treat them with in those days. Papa lived for two days. We called everyone to come and Peter, Janet and Alex came right over from Evanston, but Narval and his brother Marshall needed to drive to Lyman to get Mary and Viola. It was a terrible winter day. They arrived in Lyman alright but coming back were caught in a blizzard they were about eight miles out of Carter when the clutch went out on the car. The storm was so sever you could not see where you were walking.  Marshall and my sisters stayed in the car while Narval began walking back to Carter.  They could of all frozen to death. After walking for hours Narval came upon a house and when he knocked and the man came to the door and was told what had happened the man offered to take his tow truck hook it onto the car and pull them back to Carter. They were very lucky. All of them went to the train depot and stayed until noon the next day when they took a train to Kemmerer. Narvals brother, Winton, was getting ready to go after them with blankets and hot rocks when they called to let us know what had happened. Everyone had been scared to death, but as the saying goes \u201call's well that ends well\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\nI had stayed at the hospital all three nights that Papa was there and the family from Evanston joined me but Papa died Friday morning at seven o\u2019clock before Mary and Viola arrived. It was a very sad time for all of us. All of the children went to the house in Susie to see what needed to be done. As we went through the things some of them were divided and others sold.\n</p>\n<p>\nPapa was sixty six years old, the service were shot as it was a bitter day, and he was buried in the city cemetery beside Mama. There must have been a joyful reunion in Heaven that day where they now dwell in their Heavenly Home. The Evanston Relief Society served us a meal at the church when we came back from the cemetery and then we left to go to each of our own homes. How sad, we were now without our wonderful parents we had depended on all of our lives. We me for Family reunions for many years but now no one is left to bring us together.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have a few more memories to share. While we lived in Frontier Wyo. And Andrew and Isabel lived by us, one day Andrew wanted to borrow our washing machine. He asked me to help him carry it to his house. I didn\u2019t want to because I had been having pains in my stomach but you didn\u2019t say no to Andrew. The heavy load made the pain worse and Papa took me to Janets so I could see a doctor. After he gave me a blessing Papa went home. The doctor said I was having an appendicitis attack.  The doctor gave me a cup of olive oil and a cup of castor oil. This made me very ill just like the intestinal flu and I passed green hard rock like things. When I went back to the doctor he said \u201cLet me shake you hand young lady you had a poison that would have killed you if it hadn\u2019t come through the intestines and been carried out of the body.\u201d  Papa came to get me and took me to our doctor who told him if it was his daughter he would have operated at once. So I did have the operation. Papa put on a white jacket and mask and came in and stayed with me until the surgery was over. It felt good to have him there with me. Papa was a \u2018Rock of Gibraltar to me. I thought he was a good man.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had some hard times in our lives but our father always took care of his family.  I've often heard Janet say, \u201cWe were never without good shoes, a warm coat, and our stomachs full.\u201d That was special because many people went without in those days.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
