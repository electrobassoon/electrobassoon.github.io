No other written information seemed to be available among the Garner descendants. Therefore, the writer began a search of church history records. The findings were both amazing and thrilling. In order that we might fully appreciate the supreme sacrifice made by our ancestors for the sake of the gospel, those findings are now carefully compiled in the following life sketch.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Dora D. </strong>(Could this D. stand for Durfee?) <strong>Flack, 448 East 775 North, Bountiful, Utah</strong>) (Notice in the above paragraph that Edmund Durfee is Dolly Durfee's father <strong>not her husband.</strong> Her husband is David Garner. Dolly's <strong>mother</strong> is <strong>Magdalena Pickle.</strong> Keep this in mind as you go through the following material.)\n</p>\n<p>\n(Jim, this is not really the life story of these two people. It is just a compilation of what has been written about them in various sources.)\n</p>\n<p>\nA LIFE SKETCH OF EDMUND DURFEE AND LANA PICKLE DURFEE\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund Durfee was born in Tiverton, Newport County, Rhode Island. (Both spellings of Edmond are used in the records.) Five generations before him Thomas Durfee (born in 1643) immigrated to America from England. He settled in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. His youngest son, Benjamin, moved to Tiverton where the descendants remained until the time of Edmund, who was born October 3, 1788, the son of Perry Durfee and Annie Salisbury (Sulsbury).\n</p>\n<p>\nHow and where Edmund and Lana (Magdalena)Pickle became acquainted we do not know. At any rate Edmund married Lana Pickle about 1810. To date we have not found the exact date. She was born June 6, 1788 in Montgomery County, New York, the daughter of John and Dolly Pickle (I think there is an error here. My records show Magdalena (Lana) Pickle's parents to be John Pickle and Magdalena Saltzman. Dolly is a daughter of John and Lana and she married David Garner. Could Magdalena Saltzman have been nicknames \"Dolly\" I don't know, but her (1)last name couldn't have been Pickle. That was her father's name - John Pickle) Oh, oh, just looked at their - Edmund and Lana Pickle's - family group sheet. I'm sending it to you. Down at the bottom of the sheet it says that Lana was also called Dolly. I guess that is why they named their daughter Dolly. However, Lana was not Dolly Pickle she had to be Dolly Saltzman. Her daughter would have been Dolly Pickle.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund and Lana settled in Lennox, Madison County, New York where the following children were born: Martha born Nov. 17, 181l; Tamma born Mar.  6, 1813, Edmund born Sept. 4, 1814 Dolly born Mar. 8, 1816, John born Jan. 31, 1818, Lana or Delana born Feb. 14 (or is it the 4th), 1820\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout 1822 the family moved to Amboy, Oswego County, New York, where Edmund bought land, built a house, and cultivated a small farm. He also worked-at his trade as a carpenter and millwright. Maple trees abounded in that area, so he bought more land with many maple trees on it. Of course, they made a great deal of maple sugar. For eight happy years the family enjoyed their home in Amboy. Twelve children had been welcomed into the Durfee famly. Those born at Amboy were: William born Sept. 15, 1822, Ephraim born June 1, 1824, Abraham born Nov. 14, 1826, Henry born in 1827, Jabez born May 10, 1828, and Mary born Mar. 21, 1830.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, at that time the west was opening up and Edmund felt that opportunities were many in the new territory. So in June 1830 he sold his sugar bush and farm, and the family moved to Ohio. They travelled through Camden Village to the canal which took them to Buffalo. They crossed Lake Superior and landed at Portland. From there they moved on to Huron County and settled in the township of Ruggles. There Edmund bought property, and the Durfees made Ruggles their new home. B\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the winter of 1831 rumors began circulating about Joseph Smith and a gold Bible. In April Solomon Hancock arrived in the community. The =~ Durfees were Methodists. Often Elder Hancock preached in their chapel telling them how the Lord had sent the Angel Moroni to Joseph Smith. He explained the beautiful truths of the restored gospel. They were admonished to learn the truth, for it was much different from the rumors they had heard before hand. The gospel message found its way to the heart of Edmund and Lana and their family. Edmund was baptized in May 1831, by Simeon Carter and Lana was baptized June 1 by Solomon Hancock. Most of the children also accepted the gospel and were baptized during those months. Because Tamma was going with a young man who reportedly wouldn't have a Mormon wife, she quietly believed without being baptized until after their marriage in August.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Journal History of the Church on Tuesday, October 25, 1831, are recorded \"Minutes of a General Conference of the Church at the dwelling of Brother Serenes Burnett in the town of Orange, Cayahoga County, Ohio, 39 members present: High Priests Joseph Smith Jr., Oliver Cowdery, J. Whitmer, Hyrum Smith, Sidney Ridgon, Samuel Smith, Simeon Carter, Reynolds Cahoon, Martin Harris, Joseph Smith, Sen., Wheeler Baldwin, John Smith, Elders David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Sylvester Smith, Luke S. Johnson, B....Riggs, Sylvester Baker, Orson Hyde, Daniel Stanton, Joseph Brackenbury, William E. McLellan, Major N. Ashley, Stephen Burnett, Edmund Durfee, Joel Johnson, Levi Jackman, Emer Morris, Frederick G. Williams, Priests Lyman E. Johnson, Edmund Johnson, Benjamin Carpenter, Rugg Eames, Teachers William Smith, Uriel Stephens, Hyrum Griffith, Deacons Titus Billings, Serene Burnett, and John....... ?\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of the brethren spoke at that time and their ideas were recorded in the minutes.....\"Brother Edmund Durfee said that he also had professed religion for a number of years; yet now he felt to bear testimony of the goodness of God and also consecrate all to the Lord.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"At the evening session of the conference a number were called and ordained High Priests. After prayer President Smith said that he had a testimony that each had a talent and if, after being ordained he should hide it, God would take it away from them. He exhorted them to pray continually in meekness and said that those who previously had been ordained priests would be ordained elders and so on.....Edmund Durfee was made a High Priest.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIn December Edmund left on a mission for the church. So just before leaving he baptized his daughter, Tamma. The following February the elders cut a hole in the ice and baptized her husband, which united all the family as members of the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund accompanied Elder Joseph E. Brachenbury on his mission to Chautauqua County, New York. Quoting from Journal History we find: \"In the fall of 1831 Joel H. and Davis Johnson who had received the gospel in Amherst, Ohio, brought the Book of Mormon to their relatives in Chautauqua County, New York. Soon afterward Joel Johnson and Almon W. Babbitt (then only a boy) came to the same neighborhood as missionaries and were followed by two high priests, namely Edmund Durfee and Jos. B.  Brackenbury. 'Elder Brackenbury was an earnest and powerful preacher,\u2019 likewise Elder Benjamin Pore)Johnson' and all the elders sent were filled with the spirit of the Lord.\" Many received their testimony and my mother, Lyman R. Shearman, a brother-in-law were the first to be baptized. After a few weeks of successful preaching and baptizing Elder Brackenbury was taken violently sick and within a few days, Jan. 7, 1832, died of the billious cholic.'\n</p>\n<p>\nHistory of the Church concerning this event reads, as follows: \"Elder Joseph B. Brackenbury died at Pomfret from the effects of poison secretly administered to him by opposers, who afterwards boasted that Mormon elders had not faith enough to stand poison. The night after his burial there was a heavy snowstorm.- About half past eleven o'clock Joel H. Johnson dreamed that the persons were digging up Brother Brackenbury's body, and was so exercised about it that he called up some of the brethren and went to the spot, about one mile distant, and found a party of doctors at work, who had nearly cleared the grave of earth; the men fled with utmost precipitation. David Johnson took after the largest one who was caught and bound over in one thousand dollar bonds for his appearance at court, but was never tried.(4)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Temple site at Jackson County, Missouri, was dedicated August 3, 1831.  The saints were looking forward to establishment of \"Zion\". Consequently settlements were established in that area (Far-West). In accordance with instructions in Feb. 1832, Edmund went down to establish his claim in \"Zion\" and to build a place for his family, returning home May 20. However, the family did not move at that time because Edmund was called on another mission back to the states, which occupied his time until fall.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe following spring in May the family moved to Kirtland where most of the saints were gathering. At Kirtland when Lana was 47 years old, her thirteenth child, Nephi, was born on July 22, 1835.\n</p>\n<p>\nRevelation had been given to Joseph to build a House to the Lord in Kirtland.  Ground was broken June 5, 1833. Immediately work began and the cornerstones were laid the following month. On July 23 Edmund was one of the 24 elders who laid the cornerstones. The saints worked eagerly on the Temple at every opportunity. Edmund spent a great deal of his time in the construction of that beautiful edifice. Likewise his brother Jabez spent much time on the temple as a carver and decorator. Although it was a critical period, no sacrifice was too great in time or money. On Saturday, March 7, 1835, as the Temple was nearing completion, a meeting was called for the purpose of blessing in the name of the Lord those who had assisted in building by their labor and other means the House of the Lord in Kirtland.  The morning was occupied by Pres. Jos. Smith, Jr. in teaching the church the propriety and necessity of purifying itself. In the afternoon the names of those who had assisted to build the house were taken and further instructions received from President Smith. He said that those who had distinguished themselves thus far by consecrating to the upbuilding of the House of the Lord as well as laboring thereon were to be remembered that those who built it should own it and have the control of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"After further remarks those who performed the labor on the building voted unanimously that they would continue to laber thereon till the House should be completed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n\"President Sidney Rigdon was appointed to lay on hands and bestow blessings in the name of the Lord. The Presidents were blessed; and Reynolds Cahoon, Hyrum Smith and Jared Carter, the building committee thereof (the last two were not present, yet their rights in the House were preserved).\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The following are the names of those who were blessed in consequence of their labor on the House of the Lord in Kirland and those who consecrated to its upbuilding:....(Edmund Durfee, Sen. and Edmund Durfee, Jr. were among those named.)....All those who were blessed were given the blessings of heaven and a right in the House of the Lord in Kirtland agreeable to the labor they had performed thereon and the means they had contributed.! They were also promised wisdom and ability to proclaim the gospel. Edmund Durfee, Jr.  (5)was ordained an elder. A James Durfee was also blessed on this occasion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Temple was finally completed - truly a great monument to the faith of a small group of people who built in their poverty at a time when violence threatened them on every side.\n</p>\n<p>\nMarch 27, 1836 was indeed a memorable occesion - the Temple was dedicated! Edmund felt fully repaid for all his effort. \"Angels were present and the Holy Spirit, like the sound of a mighty rushing of wind fell upon the house and assembly. The people of the neighborhood came running together, hearing a strange sound and seeing a bright light resting on the Temple. The (6)House had been accepted by the Lord.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe financial panic of 1837 heightened insecurity. At the same time feelings against the Mormons rose to a new pitch. As a result the saints were driven from Kirtland. The Durfees hastened to Caldwell County, Missouri, settling (7)in Log Creek.\n</p>\n<p>\nApostacy was rampant in the church. Denial of the church brought relief from persecution. Misunderstandings were many and the general spirit was one of contention even within the church. Even those who were next to the Prophet himself often lost their light and understanding.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The saints assembled at Edmund Durfee Settlement in Caldwell County, Missouri, agreeable to appointment and rejected Presidents David Whitmer and William W. Phelps by unanimous vote as the Presidency of the church in (8)Missouri. Similar meeting were also held at the various settlements.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Whitmer and W. W. Phelps were charged with selling possessions in Jackson County, contrary to revelations of the Lord, which was paramount to denial of the faith; also for misappropriaton of funds borrowed for the use of the church. David Whitmer was charged with even more offenses. The Lord in a revelation had rebuked these men for their transgression and warned- them, but they did not heed the warning. Thomas Marsh and David W.  Patten were sustained as presiding officers in Missouri until the coming of President Smith and Rigdon. W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer were excommunicated March 10, 1838 with David Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery held over for investigation. Both were excommunicated later.\n</p>\n<p>\nImprisonments were numerous and always on false charges. Satan himself seemed to have been turned loose, determined to destroy the church and people of God. - Mobocrates, with Governor Boggs at their head had no respect for private property. Homes were entered by force. All weapons were forcibly taken from the Mormons even to butcher knives, so that they had no means of self-defense. Men were dragged from their homes and families and were brutally beaten, tarred and feathered, and abused in every conceivable way. No forces of government gave them redress. for these wrongs. Without hope of ever getting anything from their properties, they were finally expelled from Missouri by Nov. 1838.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund took his family and settled in Yelrome near Lima, Illinois, where they tried to find peace and the privilege of living unmolested. The church was built up considerably. The \"Lima Branch Records\" p. 385 under date of March 12, 1843 read: \"Edmund Durfee was received in full fellowship by the Lima Branch by vote.\" This record was signed by Isaac Morley, President, and James C. Snow, Clerk.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the appointing of the High Council, Elder Heber C. Kimball made some general remarks upon the Word of Wisdom. He said God looked into the heart of a man. He said some would strain nip, and tuck at the Word of Wisdom, but would turn away a poor brother when he would ask for a little meal for breakfast. He compared it to the man that was stretched upon the iron bedstead,; if he was too long they would cut him off, if he was too short they would stretch him out; and again he said it made him think of the old Indian's tree which stood so straight that it leaned a little the other way and the best way was to stand erect.\" He also made some very appropriate (11)remarks with regard to the Temple and Nauvoo House.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe beautiful city of Nauvoo rose from swampland into the largest city of Illinois at that time. The majestic temple rose steadily in the midst of sacrifice and continued persecution. Still the saints looked to Joseph as their guide. Tamma tells that they listened to the Prophet speak for five hours straight and no one was tired.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom a record of baptisms for the dead made at Morley's Settlement, on November 7, 1840 and November 14, 1840, Edmund and Lana were baptized for his parents, Perry and Annie Salisbury Durfee, and for her parents, John and Dolly??? Pickle. (See Vol. 210 p. 385, Historian's Office.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe very foundations of Mormonism shook when the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were martyred at Carthage on June 27, 1844. Confusion crowded the minds of the saints when the decision of new leadership was to be made. At a special meeting held on March 8, the question was answered unequivocally when Brigham Young stood before them to discuss the matter.  To their amazement he stood transfigured before their very eyes. It seemed they saw the Prophet Joseph before them and heard his voice as naturally as ever although it was Brigham Young speaking. Although many divisions occurred in the church at that time Edmund and Lana remained steadfast in their faith, choosing to follow the Quorum of the Twelve.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoseph had prophesied that the saints would eventually seek refuge in the tops of the mountains. Persecution continued, hastening the time of that long trek.  All efforts were turned toward outfitting wagons, laying up supplies, and preparing themselves in every way. Needless to say the constant trouble did not hasten the preparations, although the mobocrats continued to scream that the Mormons must move, and the sooner the better.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was the plan of the mob not to gather in large bodies but to burn Yelrome, then attack some other place and finally drive all the Mormons into Nauvoo.  That being accomplished they planned to move them from Nauvoo by help from other areas. Accordingly everyone was driven out of Morley's Settlement (Yelrome). Sheriff Jacob B. Backenstos wrote the following proclamation which describes the conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"September 13, 1845.....To the citizens of Hancock County, Whereas a mob of from 100 to 200 men under arms have gathered themselves together in the sourthwest part of Hancock County and are at this time destroying the dwellings and other buildings, stacks of grain and other property of a portion of the citizens and in the most inhuman manner compelling defenseless children and women to rise from their sick beds and exposing them to the rays of the parched sun and to lie and suffer without the aid and assistance of a friendly hand to minister to their wants in their suffering condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"The riotous spare not the widow nor the orphan and while I am writing this proclamation the smoke is rising to the clouds, and the flames are devouring four buildings which have been set on fire by the rioters. Thousands of dollars worth of property have already been consumed; an entire settlement of about 60 or 70 families laid waste, the inhabitants thereof fired upon (12)narrowly escaping with their lives and forced to flee before the mob.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe went on to call attention to the law and its penalties for infractions.  Although he tried earnestly to discharge his responsibility, no help came to enforce the laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nEdmund's home was among those burned to the ground. Tamma tells how her young brother (Nephi, aged 10) was simply rolled in his sick bed and thrown outdoors. The mobbers then went to the haystack, got two bundles of oats, put a firebrand in them, threw them on top of the house and said they would return in the morning. Finally that work of destruction was complete, and almost the whole town was smoldering in ruins and ashes.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom Nauvoo rushed 134 teams travelling all night and day to rescue the homeless families and take them to Nauvoo. The troublemakers agreed that the saints could return to harvest their crops. Therefore, a month later Edmund and others returned to gather their crops and harvest the grain which they needed so badly for the anticipated journey. On the 15th of November \"near Solomon Hancock's house about midnight a stack of straw was discovered on fire. Several persons turned out to suppress the flames; while thus engaged a whistle was heard east and one west; presently a gun was fired then and they continued to fire till six guns were discharged at them, the ball of the fourth one entered the body of Edmund Durfee just above the heart and he died instantly.\" His body was immediately taken to Nauvoo for burial.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe \"Nauvoo Neighbor\" put out an \"extra\" on November 19th concerning this tragic incident, A part of it is quoted:\n</p>\n<p>\n\"As may be seen by the affidavits below, it falls to our painful lot to chronicle two more outrages upon the lives and rights of the Latter-day Saints, since they have been using all diligence to secure their crops, build wagons, and leave next spring.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Mr. Durfee was one of the most industrious, inoffensive and good men that could be found, and having his house burnt in September last, moved to Nauvoo and went on Saturday last for a load of grain, was shot dead in cold blood, at midnight while striving with others to save property from the flames by an armed mob!\n</p>\n<p>\n..... \"Have nearly two thousand five hundred wagons commenced for our Pacific journey next spring, but such outrages certainly are not calculated to aid us in getting ready. We have borne the Missouri persecution; we have mourned the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith; we feel the destruction of one or two hundred houses the present season, and our hearts are pained at the murder of Edmund Durfee, because he was a good man; but, we, as in all cases of the saints, leave the disposition of these matters in the care of a wise God, and the perpetrators, to the mercy of (as they say), a country of laws, and be those laws honored or disgraced we cannot be charged with revenge; and we do beseech the people and the authorities not to impute crime to us, to raise excitement, when we see our accusers wiping the blood of innocent men, women, and children, from their (13)garments, as though this was the realm of Nero.....\"\n</p>\n<p>\nOn November 17 Orson Hyde (the presiding authority in Nauvoo), who had known Edmund for many years, wrote a letter to Brigham Young informing him of the incident. Among other things he said: \"Mr. Durfee was one of the most quiet and inoffensive citizens in these United States and from our acquaintance with him and from the nature of his business in securing his (14)crops we are persuaded that his murder was wholly unprovoked.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Edmund's death \"the mob boasted that they fired at Durfee on a bet of a gallon of whiskey that they could kill him with the first shot and they won.\"  The guilty parties were not hard to identify - they were identified by Edmund's companions. Although they were apprehended and affidavite filed concerning the incident, they were released by the magistrate without examination - another evidence of the legal farces which met all the grievances of the saints.\n</p>\n<p>\nNo one could possibly understand the grief and terror which must have filled Lana's heart at such a tragedy. Even in Nauvoo the reign of terror persisted.  All her children were married with the exception of Jabez (apparently named for Edmund's brother) and Nephi. On January 21, 1846, she received her endowments in the upper rooms of the Nauvoo Temple and was also sealed to Edmund on that date. Edmund's endowment date is January 4, 1882 (by proxy in the Endowment House.)\n</p>\n<p>\nDue to the conditions surrounding her, the insecurity and constant danger, it is not surprising that Lana married her brother-in-law, Jabez Durfee -(This then had to be Edmund's brother, not their son. Lana asked Celestia Curtis to marry her son Jabez), on January 21, 1846 (for time). Jabez's first wife, Electra Cranston, had died in 1834 at Independence, Missouri, during the Missouri mob trouble. six (and possibly seven) of the Durfee children received their endowments in the Nauvoo Temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce again expulsion faced the Durfees. Apparently Lana and Jabez and her two boys left Nauvoo with the main body of the saints. At that she is not mentioned as having remained in Nauvoo as did Tamma and one ...... as related in Tamma's \"Memorial\". At Musketol Creek, Council Bluffs, Iowa, Lana died on Mar 17, 1850, at the age of 62. After her death Jabez did not continue the journey to Utah but died at White Cloud, Iowa in April 1867(the family group sheet has him dying April 1868. This needs to be checked.)\n</p>\n<p>\nFew parents have given their descendants such a rich heritage of faithfulness and devotion to the cause of truth. May this history serve to perpetuate that faith in the hearts of those who follow after them.\n</p>\n<p>\n****************************\n</p>\n<p>\nThroughout the records various names and spellings were given for Lana - Delaney, Lainey,Laney, Delana, and Lanna.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome doubt exists as to the correct birthplace of Lana (probably a contraction of Magdelena). While many of the members of the family conclude that Lana was born in Rhode Island because her husband was born there, the old manuscript dictated by Tamma reads: \"Laney Pickle born June 6, 1768 in Holland and died May 17, 1856 in Council Bluffs.\"(This information on Laney Pickle does not agree with the information on that family's family group sheet. It needs to be checked further.) She may prove to be a descendant from the Pickle (originally spelled Pechtel or Bechtel family of Columbia Co., N.Y.)

Most of these, however, located northeast of Lima, in the extreme south end of Hancock County in which is now Walker Township on and around a townsite which had been surveyed and named Yelrome. This little town situated 2 1/2 miles northeast of Lima was also known as Morley Town or Morley's Settlement in honor of Isaac Morley, the presiding church officer residing there. At a conference held at Lima October 23, 1842 the branch was represented to consist of 424 members. Yelrome or Morley's Settlement was nearly burnt out by the mob in the fall of 1845 and the saints were all compelled to leave the following year in 1946. A new town called Tioga was laid out on the old townsite which at present consists of an unimportant village.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n11 Journal History, Sunday, June 11, 1843; also \"History of the Church,\" Vol.  7, pp 427-29<br />\n12 \"History of the Church,\"\u201d Vol. 7, page 529.<br />\n13 Ibid. pp. 528-9<br />\n14 Ibid p. 525<br />\n15 Ibid p. 524\n</p>\n<p>\nCompiled and written in March 1955, by Dora D.

Be so good as to inform us so soon as convenient.\n</p>\n<p>\nAffidavits will probably soon reach you of the above transactions.\n</p>\n<p>\nVery Respectfully, in behalf of the Council,<br />\n(signed) Orson Hyde\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\nTuesday, 18. The Twelve met in council at Dr. Richards\u2019. Mr. Brayman, attorney for the state, wrote a letter to the council desiring witnesses against the murderers of Durfee to be sent to Carthage, also affidavits forwarded in relation to the burning of Rice\u2019s house, and advising us of the arrest of George Backman, Moss and Snyder, who were charged with the murder of Elder ~ Edmund Durfee, Sen.  <br />\nThe council replied immediately and requested the witnesses to start in the morning for Carthage to perform their part in another judicial farce.\n</p>\n<p>\nNAUVOO NEIGHBOR - EXTRA<br />\nNauvoo, November 19th, 1845\n</p>\n<p>\nMURDER AND ARSON<br />\nEDMUND DURFEE SHOT - TWO HOUSES BURNED\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cAs may be seen by the affidavits below, it falls to our painful lot to chronicle two more outrages upon the lives and rights of the Latter-day Saints, since they have been using all diligence to secure their crops, build wagons, and leave next spring.\n</p>\n<p>\nMr. Durfee was one of the most industrious, inoffensive and good men that could be found, and having his house burnt in September last, moved to Nauvoo and went on Saturday last for a load of grain, was shot dead in cold blood, at midnight while striving with others to save property from the flames by an armed mob!\n</p>\n<p>\nAs to the destruction of the houses and property, and the treatment on that occasion - let the affidavit speak for itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n\u2018We have nearly two thousand five hundred wagons commenced for our Pacific journey next spring, but such outrages certainly are not calculated to aid us in getting ready. We have borne the Missouri persecution; we have mourned the loss of the Prophet and Patriarch, Joseph and Hyrum Smith; we feel the destruction of one or two hundred houses the present season, and our hearts are pained at the murder of Edmund Durfee, because he was a good man; but, we, as in all cases of the saints, leave the disposition of these matters in the care of a wise God, and the perpetrators, to the mercy of (as they say), a country of laws, and be those laws honored or disgraced we cannot be charged with revenge; and we do beseech the people and the authorities not to impute crime to us, to raise excitement, when we see our accusers wiping the blood of innocent men, women and children, from their garments as though this was the realm of Nero.\n</p>\n<p>\nAFFIDAVIT 1 THE DURFEE MURDER CASE\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cState of Illinois<br />\nHancock County\n</p>\n<p>\nPersonally appeared before me, Aaron Johnson a justice of the peace within and foresaid county, James H.

The Twelve met and prayed.<br />\nCOURSE OF MAJOR WARREN REPORTED - BACKENSTOS\n</p>\n<p>\nSheriff Backenstos came into council about 7 p.m., and said that he had watched Major Warren very closely for the last four days, though he had turned Jack-Mormon, that he had been very busy and energetic in arresting the murderers of Durfee and the burners of Rice\u2019s house, that he had several of them under guard at Carthage and was in pursuit of more and had chased one of them into Missouri and forced him back at the point of the pistol without any requisition from the governor. He admitted to Backenstos that Durfee would not have been murdered had the troops not been in the county; notwithstanding Governor Ford\u2019s late letter to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p>\nMonday, 24. Ten a.m., Brother Heber C. Kimball and I called at the Historian\u2019s Office and read history with Dr. Richards and George A. Smith.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe council wrote Elder Theodore Turley who is now in jail awaiting his examination.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have learned that the persons who murdered Edmund Durfee as also those who burned Rice\u2019s and Hick\u2019s houses were discharged by the magistrate without examination. Our brethren went according to Major Warren and Mr. Brayman\u2019s request as witnesses thereby fulfilling their part towards magnifying and making the laws honorable, but returned unheard, and the farce closed sooner than he had anticipated, without even a grand jury on the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nA Short Story of the Life of Ida M. Rollins Hamblin<br />\nby Ida M. Rollins\n</p>\n<p>\nI was born of goodly parents in a very primitive cottonwood log house with a dirt roof on the 2nd day of October 1862 in a small pioneer village situated on the banks of the Bear River in the southwestern part of Utah. The place derived its name Minersville on account of their being so many miners in that locality. My parents were James Henry Rollins, born in Lima New York on the 27th day of May 1816, and Eveline Walker Rollins, born the 16th of May 1823 in or near Dayton, Ohio. They were early Pioneers of Utah immigrating from Nauvoo to Winter Quarters in February 1846 \u2014 lived there through the year 1847 and from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City \u2014 arrived there in October 1848.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the time of the great gold rush to California in 1849, Father went to California in company with Charles C. Rich and Amasa Lyman. At this same time, George Q.  Cannon accompanied them on his way to the Hawaiian Islands as a missionary for the LDS Church. Father returned from California in 1850 bringing a considerable amount of gold dust which he had obtained with him. At this time flour was very scarce in Utah and I have heard him say he went all over Salt Lake trying to trade gold dust for flour but there was none to be had. I have heard Mother say before Father came back from California that she had some mildewed corn meal and she would make bread of it and they would have to hold their noses while they ate it. The odor was so offensive.\n</p>\n<p>\nBrigham Young called a few of the families to go to California and found a Colony. So in the spring of 1857 Father moved with his family to California in company with C.C. Rich and Amasa Lyman. While Father was gone, he left Mother with three small children, the youngest just a few months old. They hired a young English girl, Hannah Humes, an orphan whose father had died at sea on his way to Utah. Her mother had died in England. When they went to go to California, Hannah wanted to go with them. Father asked President Young whether he should take her or not and he advised Father to bring her to the Endowment House and have her sealed to him, which he did on the 3rd of March 1851.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather helped to found the city of San Bernardino and was the first merchant there, establishing a store on the spot where there is a large post office building at the present time. They were called back to Utah in 1858 at the time of the invasion of the Johnston\u2019s Army. Enroute home from California, Mother got frightened by some Indians at Santa Clara, Utah and it caused her to be very sick. She lost a baby girl which was premature and her life was dispared of. But by the administration of the Elders, she survived and they traveled on until they came to Cedar City. Father tried to obtain a house there to lie in but failed and they traveled on the Parowan to stop for a while until Mother got strong enough to travel on to Salt Lake which was their destination. But while there, the Brethren got word from Brigham Young for them to stay in the southern part of Utah and help to strengthen the settlements of the south. So they lived in Parowan for two years.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1860 Father was called to go to Minersville to be the Bishop of that place.  While living in California, Mother gave birth to two sons. Charles Lyman was born the 10th of November 1854 and James Watson was born May 24, 1856. Father's other wife, Hannah, gave birth to three children. The first was a boy baby which only lived a day and Caroline and George who were born the 19th of March 1856. While living in Parowan, Hannah gave birth to a son, Robert Francis, born the 18th of November 1858.  Father moved his wife Hannah over to Minersville in 1860 and later moved Mother over.  Hannah lost her little girl Caroline in Minersville when she was eight years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was my Mother\u2019s tenth child, four of them dying while small. I spent my childhood days in Minersville. I attended school there and learned my ABC's there, as it was then called. The first school that I remember attending was taught by my father's sister, Mary E. Lightner. She taught in an old adobe meeting house which was used for church and all kinds of amusements and a school house.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy Grandmother Walker lived with my mother\u2019s sister, Dionitia Walker Lyman.  The night I was born, Mother sent my brother Watson up to stay with Grandmother.  When it was time for him to come back home, Grandmother pleaded with Mother to let him stay there. So he lived there nine years until Grandmother died. I stayed there a great deal of the time as I liked to be with my Grandmother. When I was seven years old, my sister Melissa got married to John N. Lee of Panaca, Nevada. After that, Mother and I would try and make a trip to see her every year if she did not come to visit us.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy father was the first post master in Minersville. He also kept the first stage station and a Tavern, as a hotel was called. I first learned to read writing as I was handing out letters in the Post Office when Father wasn't in. He was Post Master for a great many years.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather found and owned in with several others the first lead mine in Utah. A Brother Issiac Grundy built a primitive shelter on the north bank of the Beaver River and run out lead bars of 1 Lb and 5 lbs. Father would freight the lead bars to Salt Lake and sell it to make bullets and white lead.\n</p>\n<p>\nFather and Albert Stoddard bought and installed a molasses mill and the people in town raised sugar cane. They would bring the cane to them and they would run the cane through a mill and get the juice. They had several large vats which were built over a furnace. They would put the juice in these vats and boil it down to molasses. As it boiled they would have to skim it. We children would have a great time. We would get the skimmings and make candy of it. The women folk would make vinegar of it also.  We never knew what it was to buy vinegar. Mother had a 5 gallon keg and she always kept it full.\n</p>\n<p>\nMother made candles out of tallow. I remember the first coal oil lamp we ever had. Mother was afraid to light it for fear it would blow up. She had a spinning wheel and loom to weave cloth on. She spun the yarn and dyed it. I remember she made me a plaid woolen dress, and herself and the other children clothes. She made yarn and knit all our stockings. She also gathered saleratus from the ground (we call it alkali now) and would make soap of it to last all winter. Thus the pioneers would work and save everything. To make a living she would also gather straw and braid our hats. We felt very proud of our straw hats.\n</p>\n<p>\nI attended the schools which were held about three months of the year called a quarter. The teachers would charge three to four dollars apiece for each student which they would take in produce of all kinds and some would have wood to pay their tuition.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I was about 10 or 11, my brother Charles was called as a missionary to the border between Utah and Arizona to build a fort at a place called Lee\u2019s Ferry on the Colorado River against the Navajo Indians. I remember they, the Indians, came up as far as Minersville and would run off the horses and cattle. Before this time, Jacob Hamblin had been called down there to try and make peace with the Indians. Oscar Hamblin, my husband\u2019s father accompanied him with his family and settled at Santa Clara where Wallace and William twins were born April 27, 1862. Several years after Charles returned home, he was married to Miss Ada Dotson. I kept on attending school and when about 13 or 14 we had some very good school teachers. I attended these schools until I was in the 5th reader. That was how the grades were determined in those days.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had several teachers that came from the B.Y. Academy at Provo. They enthused me so much telling me what a wonderful school it was, that I was so thrilled about it I wanted to go there. At the Christmas holidays in 1880, Apostle F.M. Lyman and his son F.M. Lyman Jr. came to our house on their way back from a holiday vacation to Parowan. F.M. Jr. was a student at B.Y.A. I asked my parents if I could go back with them and attend the B.Y.A. in Provo. They consented to let me go so I got ready in a hurry. This was my first trip away from home alone. Sometimes I would get very homesick, but that wonderful old man, Karl G. Maeser, was so kind. When he would find a student that was blue and homesick, he would put his arms around you and cheer you up and make you feel alright. I only stayed there in Provo until the April Conference. I attended conference and then returned home on account of being short of funds.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile there, I boarded with one of Heber C. Kimball's wives, Lucy Walker Kimball. I assisted in the kitchen mornings and evenings as part pay for my room and board. She allowed me $1.00 per week for my work and I paid $3.00 per week cash. I roomed with four other girls namely, Saddie Sheppard of Beaver, Utah who afterward became the wife of Rhinard Maeser, so of Principal Karl G. Maeser, Rosa Lee from Beaver who became the wife of George Southerland one of the Supreme Judges of the United States Court, and Lessa Kimball and Maggie Christmas both of Salt Lake City.  Part of the time I roomed with J. Golden Kimball's mother who lived in another part of the house. There were several boys boarded there also. Golden was the senior over the house. We all had to be in the dining room at a certain time of the morning for prayers.  Several times some of us girls would not get in there in time for prayers and Golden would always report us to Professor Maeser. We would be called onto the carpet, but he was very kind to us and would say, \u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d Those were very happy days for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter returning home from school, Mother, Father and I made a visit to my sister Melissa Lee\u2019s in Panaca, Nevada. After we came home, my niece Lydia Osborn was marred to M.C. Morris of Salt Lake. Wallace Hamblin, my boy friend or beau as we then called them, returned home from a trip to Wyoming where he had been assisting in driving some cattle to the market in Cheyenne. My brother Watson and Harriet Eyre were preparing to get married in December so we decided to accompany them and make it a double affair. My brother obtained a white top buggy and Wallace a light spring wagon and we set off for St. George on Sunday morning. It took us three days to get there. We were married in the St. George Temple Wednesday the 14th of December 1881. We stayed over on Thursday and took in the sights of the city.\n</p>\n<p>\nA very strange thing happened to us while in St. George. The man where we stopped, a Brother Hall, wanted us to take a 60 gallon barrel of wine to Milford to ship North to his son. It was decided that we take it as we had a wagon. We had not traveled very far until a boy came riding up and said something was spilling out of our wagon. On investigating we found some of the hoops had broken off the barrel so we tipped it on the other end and we went on and pretty soon the hoops broke off that end. Then we turned the barrel on its side thinking we could save some that way, but the staves broke in the center and it all leaked out, and all our bedding was soaked with wine. We tried in all the settlements to obtain a barrel or keg, but could not get one. Brother Hall was very angry about it and wanted us to pay for it. We could not help it, and of course we did not pay for it.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe arrived home on Sunday just as church was dismissed and they gave us cheers of welcome was we passed by them. Our parents had a fine reception for us after our return. On the 28th of December, Wallace was best man and I was bride\u2019s maid to a very dear girl friend, Jane Stoddard, and Tine Brigham, a cousin of mine. We had very gay times in our early wedded life. It being the winter holidays, there was a dance or some kind of amusements going on every night, and in those days they would last until the wee small hours of the morning.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy brother Watson and wife and Wallace and I all lived at home with my parents.  The men folk spent the winter freighting and hauling ore from the Lincoln Mines to Milford. The following spring, March 28, 1882, Wallace\u2019s twin brother William and Mrs.  Rosa Wood were married in the St. George Temple. In the spring and summer the men spent their time farming.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe following September 7th, Watson's wife presented him with a fine son, Watson Loraine Rollins \u2014 Grandparents and all just idealized him. As for myself, I thought I could not possibly think any more of a baby than I did of him, until the following December 12, 1882. We were happy parents of a fine son, Wallace Eugene. Naturally he was the nicest baby ever born. The two boys grew up together and as far as affection goes I think two brothers could not have loved one another more than they did.  After our babies came, my brother and his wife moved to a place of their own and Wallace and I remained with my parents.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn May after we were married, I accompanied my parents to St. George Temple and assisted them in doing work for their kindred dead. While there, Sister Lucy B.  Young had my Aunt Mary Lightner, my mother and I accompany her to a room several stories up which had an altar in it. She then gave each one of us a blessing in tongues and then she interpreted them. One thing she said in my blessing was that I should have a son and that he would go to the nations of the earth and preach the Gospel (which was fulfilled). When Eugene was 21 years old, he and Lorraine both went on missions in the same year and returned the same year. Both fulfilling honorable missions.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe years went on and we were struggling to make a living and trying at the same time to build us a home. During the summer of 1884, Wallace and Henry Hall of Minersville made a kiln of brick to burn them. While he was thus employed, we were again presented with another fine son. On the 3rd of December 1884, Claudious Lee was born. We were trying to keep one of the first commandments to multiply and replenish the earth. I thought that was our mission here. There was no race suicide in those days especially with the Mormon people.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next summer we had a two-room brick home put up on a lot, with an apple and pear orchard on it, in the center of town. We had bought the lot of Wallace\u2019s Uncle George Marshall. We did not get our house finished until January 1887. We still lived with my parents. On the 19th of January, the stork brought us another son, Edwin Rollin. Our home had just been plastered and as soon as we thought it was dry enough, we moved into it with our three children.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe enjoyed being to ourselves very much, although it was hard for me to leave Father and Mother to do for themselves. They were getting along in years and were not able to do everything for themselves. But we were only two short blocks away and we would help them with their hardest work. When the boys were large enough to assist them with their chores, one of them stayed there and helped them all they could.\n</p>\n<p>\nTime went on and my husband\u2019s mother, Mary Ann Hamblin, moved to Salt Lake with her two daughters, Effie and Essie Stoddard. She took up obstetrics and became a very efficient doctor and nurse. This was during a building boom in Salt Lake, and as work around home in Minersville was very scarce, she sent for Wallace and his brother William to come up there to Salt Lake with their teams to work. They took their families with them. They obtained work hauling rock and building material.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe, both families, lived together until the fall of 1890. Just before the October Conference of the LDS Church, we decided we would try and get a house or an apartment and move to ourselves. We set out house-hunting and when we would see a house for rent, we would inquire about it. Invariably they would ask, \u201cHave you any children?\u201d \u201cYes, we have three small sons.\u201d Their answer would be, \u201cNo! We can't rent to anyone with children.\u201d Very discouraged I went up to Wallace\u2019s mother and told her of our trouble in trying to get a house. In a joking way I said, \u201cWell, 'll go home where I can have all the children we want and nobody will bother us.\u201d We were expecting the stork to again visit us.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy parents came up to Salt Lake to attend conference and I returned home with them. Wallace stayed in Salt Lake to work. One day early in February, I was returning home from Mother\u2019s with Rollin a hold of my hand. As we were passing our corral, a cow that had just been brought up off the range with a young calf took after us. We just escaped her horns by crawling through some bars close by.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next morning I was quite sick. My sister Birdie was staying with me. She was a child about 12. I called her and sent for my mother and Aunt Dee who was a mid-wife.  I got some better but continued being ill for three days. On the 6th of February 1891 I gave birth to twin girls. They were very tiny and no one had any idea they would live.  We put them both on the scales together and they just weighed 7 lbs. My husband was still in Salt Lake. My brother Watson and his wife were all with me when I was in trouble.  He went for the Elders and brought them to bless and name the babies. We all thought they would die because they groaned every breath they drew. We gave them the names of Ida Melissa and Addie Manerva.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were so small and delicate and quite a care for a long time. My husband being away made it quite hard for me to care for them in my weakened condition. But my dear old mother would come up every day and do all she could to help me and would stay with me until the babies would quiet down for the night. Mother would help me with them until they got so they were better and easier to take care of. After the babies were five months old, they seemed to thrive and grow from then on. By the way, when they were born I did not have anything to put on them as they were too small to dress. So they were just wrapped in cotton and a shawl until we were able to get some clothes made for them. Their father did not see them until they were three months old. When he returned home from Salt Lake he had been working for a furniture man and brought home two high chairs and a baby bug%y and a nice rocking chair for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the twins, came our 4th son, William Clark born on the 20th of September 1893. In three more years our 5th son, Henry Marcene, was born on the 18th of November 1896.  These children, seven of them, were all born in Minersville, Utah.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had five boys and we began to think about their future. There were no facilities or opportunities there for them to branch out. We had only a few acres of land besides our city lot. There was nothing for them to do when they got older, or land to get houses for themselves. There was no room in Southern Utah for the fast multiplying generation to grow into, so Wallace\u2019s Uncle Ephraim Marshall and a friend, William McKnight, went up in the northern part of Utah to a place called Lucerne Valley, trying to find a place for their fast growing families.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey returned with glowing reports of the country and several of the married men with large families took their word for it and were very much enthused about the story.  Several of them sold their homes and prepared to move to this new place where there was plenty of land and water. A company was formed and on the 7th of September 1897 about 2 p.m. they made a start \u2014 for they thought to better their conditions financially.  This company was all composed of sons and daughters of the early pioneers of Utah.  The company was composed of Ephraim Marshall, his wife and family, James Watson Rollins, his wife and family, Charles L. Rollins, his wife and family, William Hollinshead, his wife and child, William McKnight, his wife and family, Clarence Rollins and his wife, and John Corbridge making a total of 35 souls. The party had 11 wagons, 3 buggies, 30 work horses, 140 head of cattle and some loose animals.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe day of their leaving was a very eventful one in the history of their lives.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen they left, sad indeed was the parting, for probably years would pass before many of them would meet again and some of them never. The pioneers were given a fine farewell party in the Minersville Chapel. Fond farewells were taken of their loved ones.  Groups of friends on street corners said goodbye and wished them success and God speed on their way. The Bishop of the Ward George Eyre, escorted them for several miles out of the town promptly at 2 p.m. They turned their faces Northward to what they thought would be a new and better home.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey camped the first night near Beaver. Camping was quite a novelty to some for them, especially the young ones. By the time the travelers reached Fillmore, in Millard County, they were joined by John Henry Blackner and wife and family. This enlarged the company by eleven souls, 2 wagons, several horses and 18 head of cattle.\n</p>\n<p>\nWallace and I were preparing to go with the company, but we did not get our affairs settled in time to leave with them. We sold our home and what land we had in the field. We gathered up our belongings and just a week after the company left, we started out on the 13th of September 1897. There were 9 souls of us, 3 wagons, 7 horses, 2 cows and a dozen chickens. We joined the other company at Mona, Utah making 10 families with 52 souls in company.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe little band of emigrants struggled along, part of the way made difficult by the sickness of some of its members. My brother Charles\u2019 family, all but three were very sick with Mountain Fever. During the entire trip of five weeks, some of the family were very sick. In the evening, at the bedside of some of the sick, prayers were offered up for the afflicted and the sincere supplications were heard and answered. We passed through many trying experiences, but the march continued on, all striving to make the best of what came. We had one of our wagon boxes built as a sheep wagon with a bed and stove which made it very convenient for the family to eat and sleep. We with four of the smaller children slept in the wagon. The three older boys had to make their beds on the ground. The other two wagons were driven by Lee and Rollin \u2014 one 12 and the other 10 years old. Eugene, riding a saddle horse, helped to drive the cattle and loose horses.  We had traveled through stormy weather since leaving Heber City, which made it very disagreeable especially for those that had to make their beds on the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn the 15th of October we drove into the far famed Lucerne Valley which is now called Manila. Here we met my husband's brother William and his wife and family and Nathanial Goodman and his son William. These people had preceded the band in May that same year. My brother Watson and family and us with our family made our camp at his brother William\u2019s place. He had a large sawed log house partially completed. Others of the company camped at a place called Birch Springs. We were very much disappointed with the surroundings \u2014 it not being as represented. I think we women folk were more disappointed than the men.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey all got busy and staked off some land and then they prepared and went to the mountains to cut logs to build houses with as winter was coming on. They did not seem very enthused over the prospects as some real estate men from Ogden had the water question in hand and they wanted $1,600 for a water right for 160 acres. After the men folk arrived in the timber, they talked over the situation. They decided to leave the women and families there and go and see if they could find a more suitable place to locate.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey went to Ft. Bridger. When they arrived at Bridger Valley, a Mr. Sam Strong told them about the Carter Canal and a lot of land on the \u201clower bench\u201d which was vacant. Without going any further they bought the Carter canal for the sum of $1,500 and each one of them located, staked off 160 acres of land, and filed on it while there.  They borrowed the money to file from Mr. Joseph Guild who was a merchant at Ft.  Bridger. They had left their money with their wives and just taken enough for traveling expenses. Wallace filed on a place 3 % miles northeast of Lyman located on the Blacks Fork River. They were gone just a week when they returned and told us women what they did. We soon packed up and moved right over. We were just a week coming over from Lucerne Valley to Bridger Valley. There was a big snow storm that came on us enroute. We arrived at Mt. View on the 8th of November in a terrible blizzard. We stopped at the first place we came to which was Wallace Stevens\u2019 ranch. They had all of the boys that had been sleeping out come in the house and make their beds on the floor. We never forgot the kind hospitality Mr. Stevens and wife showed us.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next day we all found houses to live in at Mt. View. My brother Watson and our family rented a small two-room house and each family had a room a piece with no door between us. We put our sewing machines against the door for a partition but the children would climb over them. We managed fairly well with our sheep wagons for the boys to sleep in.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe children that were old enough went to school in Mt. View. Their teacher was a Miss Estella Sullen from Fort Bridger. As soon as we were located for the winter, the men folk got ready and went to the mountains to get out logs for their houses and out buildings. They had the houses partly done by the forepart of March 1898. We moved into our two-room Io% house before it was chinked or daubed with a dirt roof and dirt floor. This was the 9th of March and there was a terrible blizzard on.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was a small branch of the LDS Church here, presided over by Samuel R.  Brough. They had Sunday School in Brother Joseph Wall's house which was only partly completed. Brother Henry Voss was superintendent. It was a branch of the Summitt Stake of the LDS Church. When our company came, it swelled the membership quite considerable in numbers. We used to bring our family and drive over from Mt. View to attend Sunday School. Very soon the authorities of the church came out and organized us into a ward with 8.R. Brough as Bishop, Ephraim Marshall, one of our company, as first counselor and Augustus Youngberg as second counselor.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had quite a hard struggle clearing our land of sage brush and getting it fenced. All hands would have to work making ditches and plowing the land. They got a few acres of wheat and oats in and some potatoes. They also put in several acres of Lucerne. They bought the lucerne seed on the road out here.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhenever the men could get a job working out, they would do so to get money to buy feed for their teams. Rollin, who was 11 years old after we came, hired out to Joseph Strong for 8 dollars per month. He obtained enough money to get him a suit of clothes and other things to attend school with. Lee hired out as a sheep camp tender.  Eugene and Lee both worked for a Mr. Marchasault. They managed to attend school in the winter. We had been married 15 years when we moved to Wyoming.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter my brothers Charles, Watson and myself moved here and left our parents in Minersville, they were not contented. They sold their home and came to cast their lot with their children. They arrived here on the 8th of July 1898 and made their home with me. Father's health had been very poor for several years and this climate was very severe on him. He was suffering with Brights Disease and he passed away on the 7th of February 1899 \u2014 just living seven months after he came. He was the first man buried in the Lyman Cemetery. Father would have been 83 years old the following May 27.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy husband\u2019s mother came up to Wyoming that same winter after we came.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe came as Doctor and Nurse for Mrs. Ida Marshall and Mrs. Hannah Blackner and she brought them both fine sons, John Marshall and Bernard Blackner. Grandma Hamlin while here, filed on 160 acres of land just below the Lyman dugway and sent for her son-in-law Lue Pope and daughter Effie to come up. They lived in a one-room log house that she had built on her farm and they farmed the place.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy father and mother would go and stay for a week or so at a time with each one of my brothers but would soon get homesick and want to came back to my place where their bed and things were.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat fall after they came, there was quite a snow storm. My son Lee took his rifle and went over the ridge from our place and shot an antelope. He was only 13 years old.  He tried to lift the antelope on his horse but could not, so he came home for help. When he told father he had killed an antelope, he doubted it until Lee showed him some blood and hair that he had got on him trying to lift it on his horse. Father was as excited about it as Lee was. They took a small sleigh and tied a rope around the horn of a saddle.  Rollin went out with to help bring it in and then Father showed the boys how to skin and dress the antelope. We certainly enjoyed this meat and sent all our neighbors a fry.  This was the fall of 1898.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt Christmas time, the Sunday School had a program and a Christmas tree held in Ephraim Marshall\u2019s new house. In January, Father and Mother went to my brother Watson\u2019s to visit for a week or so. While there, Father took quite sick so they came home to my place. He did not get down helpless in bed but would only lie down at intervals. He failed very fast and he passed away while sitting in his chair at 5 p.m. on the 7th of February 1899. Just the day before Father died was my twin girls 8th birthday.  Lee had just got him a violin and was trying to play it while the girls were singing and dancing and having a great time. Father got up out of his chair and leaned on the door and watched the children play. He enjoyed them very much and would sit an evening and tell them stories of his hunting trips while crossing the plains and to California.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 1899 we sent Eugene down to Salt Lake to school. He was staying with my sister Mary Osborn. He was getting along fine in school when he contracted a cold and had a very severe spell of bronchitis. So as soon as he was able, she sent him home as she was not able to take care of him. We sent Rollin to Carter Station in the night after him, as he was the only one home.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy husband and Lee were away working on the railroad at Spring Valley. Before he left he brought his mother down to stay with me as we were expecting the stork that afternoon. I had a terrible hemorrhage and gave birth to a fine baby boy, but it never lived. My life was dispared of and only through faith and prayer and power of the priesthood through the Elders, Bishop Brough and Ephraim Marshall, was my life spared. This was the 22nd of November 1899 \u2014 the same night that Eugene came home sick. I was a long time gaining my strength and before getting around, I had a severe spell of pleurisy.\n</p>\n<p>\nTime went on and we kept on improving our farm and every year getting a little more land under cultivation and fenced. But the men folk would have to go away from home and work whenever they would get a chance. In the year 1901, Cumberland coal mines had just opened up and there was a lot of work over there. Eugene and Lee went over and obtained work. Along in the summer I decided I would go over and cook for the boys. I was not very well and would consult the Doctor there about myself, as there was no doctor here at that time. When the crops were all gathered and taken care of, my husband came over to Cumberland and obtained work in N.2 south mine.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout the middle of September I took sick with another terrible hemorrhage and as I was expecting the stork again about the first of December, I was frightened very bad. My husband was over to Lyman. I aroused Eugene and had him go across the street and get Erastus Hollingshead to go to No.1 Cumberland for the Doctor. He had a team there, so he got the doctor and gave me some medicine and told me to stay in bed until I was better. I did so for several days and I would feel alright then. As soon as I would get on my feet and try to do anything I would start to hemorrhage again so I lingered on that way for three weeks and on the 7th of October my baby came. He was premature and was very small and delicate. He was a fine boy \u2014 if he had been much finer we could not have found him. Lee came in and saw him all done up in a small bundle and says, \u201cHello, Bobby\u201d and that is how he got the name of Bob. I was confined to my bed from then on until the middle of December. We still lived in Cumberland until the next Spring, when we moved back to the farm.\n</p>\n<p>\nEugene was called in September 1802 with Loraine Rollins, Thomas J. Brough and Jay Marshall to go to B.Y. Minerscity and take a missionary course. Then in April 1903 he was called on a mission for the LDS Church to what was then the Colorado Mission. We only had two weeks to prepare him for this mission. He left Salt Lake on the 22th of April. He filled a very honorable mission. Sometimes we did not know where we were going to get money to keep him on but somehow by scheming and working it came. Lee and Rollin worked out most of the time and helped to keep him, and Wallace, his father, would take care of the farm. Then to help out, every week I would take a team and buggy and go around the Valley and gather up butter, eggs and vegetables and go to Spring Valley and Cumberland and peddle them. So with all of us working, we managed to keep him. He was released and returned on the 23 of July 1905.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe went to Salt Lake and obtained work as a street car conductor and afterwards worked for the S.L. Hardware and Implyment Co. He worked for them for several years.\n</p>\n<p>\nRollin, my 3th son, was called to go to Paris, Idaho to take a missionary course.  He was called to go the Australia. He left for this mission the 19th of October 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 1909 Lee leased a hotel in Elko, Wyoming, a coal mining camp near Kemmerer. He wanted the girls to go and run it for him but I would not let them go unless I went with them. We rented our farm and moved over there and kept boarders for the Company. We had as high as 60 boarders at the time. There is where Lee met Miss Mary Easton. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple on the 11% of November 1909. While there we were able to send money to Rollin on his mission. Wallace worked in the boiler house.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had a ward of the Church there with Wallace Cragon as Bishop. I was put in as Relief Society President and Lee was put in as Y.M.M.A President. I had my Counselors, Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Christenson. I remained president until we moved home in the spring of 1910.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter moving back home to Lyman, the girls went to Salt Lake to obtain work to help keep their brother Rollin on his mission. They got work in the Troy Laundry and their brother Eugene was working for the Consolidated Wagon and Machine Co. so they rented apartments and cooked for him. They worked there until Rollin returned from his mission.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll this time, Addie was corresponding with Levi Blad of Panaca, Nevada, who went to Australia on a mission at the same time as Rollin and returned at the same time.  They came home in February 1911 and Addie and Levi were married the following November 15th in the Salt Lake Temple. After having a reception here at home they went to Panaca, Nevada to make their home.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Addie left and separated from her sister Ida, it was one of the hardest things I had to put up with in life. Within the next seven or eight months, three more of my children were married. Eugene met and married Miss Pauline Zabriskie on April 9th 1912. Rollin married Miss Cora Roberts on the 28th of February 1912. Ida married Eugene Eyre on the 5th of June 1912, so that left our home kind of desolate. My mother was still living with me.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the summer I made a trip to Panace, Nevada to visit my daughter and sister Melissa Lee. While there I was called home on account of the illness of my mother. My sister Melissa from Panaca also came home with me and my sister Mary Osborn from Salt Lake was called. We found mother very bad and she passed away on the 25th of September 1912. She was buried by the side of father in the Lyman Cemetery. Mother\u2019s children were all at her bedside at her passing. Mary, Melissa, Charles, Watson and myself. She was then in her 90th year.\n</p>\n<p>\nAddie remained home that winter as she was expecting the stork. She was presented with a fine baby girl, Phyllis, on the 29th of November 1912. On the following December 7%, Rollin\u2019s wife presented him with a fine son, Edwin Wallace. Rollin lives on a farm in Milburn. He has lived there since 1918. He has a family of seven children, five boys and two girls. Two are married and each have two little girls to bless their homes.  Lee has a family of three, two girls and one boy. A girl Lela died of Diphtheria at the age of 10. Eugene has one boy.\n</p>\n<p>\nEugene came to Lyman to live and kept the post office and a small confectionary.  He has always from infancy been afflicted with bronchitis. When the terrible plague of the Spanish Flu came along he contracted it and pneumonia set in. He passed away on the 16th of October 1918.\n</p>\n<p>\nPauline and their son Robert were very sick at the same time and was not able to attend the funeral. My husband and son Robert and Lucille were all down with the flu and Robert had pneumonia. They were all very bad. These were very trying times for me. I was just recovering from the flu myself. Eugene\u2019s son, Robert, died four years later on June 22, 1923, with diphtheria in Salt Lake City.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the year 1916, the United States became involved in trouble with Mexico and our son, Marcene, enlisted in the National Guard June or July 5th He with three other boys went to Cheyenne and from there to the Mexican border and served there until March 1917. He returned home March 10th and went to Cumberland and obtained work in the mines there. He only worked a few shifts when he was called back to World War I in April. He helped guard the Aspen tunnel, then was called to go to Kemmerer and train men for the war. He went from Cheyenne then to Camp Dix, North Carolina. While there he was taken sick and went to the hospital. He had two quarts of water drawn off his lungs. He went to Camp Mills, New York. After being there for several months, the company embarked for France. While off the coast of Ireland, their ship was torpedoed by a German submarine but it missed its mark about 50 feet. The United States ship turned their guns on it and it went down. Their ship landed at Belgrade, France between Christmas and New Year's Eve. We received a telegram from the Red Cross on New Year's Eve that their ship had landed safely, which was a great relief to us all. Marcene remained in France until March 1919, when he was mustered out and returned home on the 11th of March. Through prayers and supplications he never had to face the firing line, but was kept very busy hauling supplies and training men with the gas masks. Our son, Eugene, passed away during Marcene\u2019s absence.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next year, on September 25, 1920, Marcene married Miss Duella Eyre.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom this union there are four children, two boys and two girls \u2014 Ivan, Geraldine, Dale and Darlene. They are living in Murray, Utah.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 1922, due to a strike in the mines in Cumberland, Lee, Clark and Marcene all came home. We let Lee have our farm and Clark stayed there and helped that summer.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat fall on November 1%, my husband obtained work in the Union Pacific shops in Green River. Clark went to Reliance, Wyoming, and obtained work in the mines there.  Marcene went to Salt Lake and then to Murray, Utah. I stayed in Lyman that winter with Robert and Lucille in school. In May, 1923 we moved to Green River and Robert worked for the Union Pacific and Lucille was working for the Union Telegraph Co.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile working in Green River, we bought a two-room house and a lot in Lyman.  On December 14, 1931, Wallace and I were married 50 years and our children got together and planned a celebration. They gave us a lovely Golden Wedding reception at the high school. They served a lovely dinner and presented us with a beautiful over- stuffed set of chairs. All our children and grandchildren and two great grandchildren were present. Our son Eugene and three grandchildren had passed away. We had a very pleasant time meeting so many relatives and friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe lived in Green River nearly 10 years. My husband was laid off on his birthday when he was 70 years old. The Union Pacific gave us a pass on the railroad to the Western States and the Pacific Coast. We started out from Green River on the 4 of May and went on the O.S. line to Murtah, Idaho, where we visited an old neighbor, William Goodman and family. We went from there to La Grande, Oregon, and visited a grand niece, Wanda Mathews Zanejg and then went to San Francisco, California and visited my niece, Daisy Rollins Hollingshead and family at San Leandro. Then we visited another neighbor, Mrs. Cora Shurtz at Santa Cruz, California. She took us all around.  We went to the big giant redwood forest and on to the coast where we gathered sea shells and watched the tide come in. We had a very pleasant time while there.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe went from there to Burbank, California, where my sister Addie Rollins Colton lives and visited with her and family for ten days. We went to Long Beach and saw two of my nieces, Mrs. Neva Osborn Davie and her sister Hattie Kennedy and their families and grand nephew, Clarence Grenig and wife and family, also his father, Dan Grenig.  We also saw a girl pal of mine, Jane Bingham. We went to Los Angeles and saw a niece and nephew, Linda Rollins Scott and Guy Rollins.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe took the train from there and visited San Bernardino where my parents lived from 1851 until 1858. We were shown the pioneer house and where my father's dwelling was and also his store where there is a very large post office built there now.  We started from there on the S.L. and Los Angeles line. Our next stop was at Las Vegas, Nevada. We visited our daughter Lucille at the Blue Diamond Mine where her husband, Earl Long, was teaching school. We went to the Boulder Dam which was under construction. From there we went to visit our daughter Addie Hamblin Blad and family. While there I was quite sick, also Lucille who accompanied us there. My husband had the hay fever quite bad and was anxious to get home. This was the 1% of July 1932 and it was the last time I saw Addie alive.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe went from there to Minersville, our former home town, and spent the 4th of July there. I had a sister and brother living there and a great many relatives and enjoyed visiting them very much. We journeyed on to Salt Lake and Murray where our son, Marcene, and family live. We stayed there for a few days and arrived home in Lyman on the 13th of July 1932, having been over two months on our trip which we enjoyed very much.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe moved in our two-room house and enjoyed it very much. During this year I had a very bad foot with varicose ulcers and was not able to be on my feet very much.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn February, Addie took very sick with what we thought was the flu. Her trouble seemed to be all in her back. She got better for a while, but at intervals would be very bad so they decided that she must go to St. George. They took her to Dr. McGreager and he took and x-ray of her and found that she had a stone in one of her kidneys. But her heart was so bad that she was not able to have an operation at that time so she returned home. In May she returned for an operation. While on the operating table they took a stone out of her kidney 2 1/2 inches long and then they decided to take out her kidney as it had started to decay. She passed away on the operating table on the 12th of May and was buried in Panaca, Nevada on the 14th of May. Surviving her was her husband, Levin Blad, and eight children, her parents and five brothers and two sisters who all attended her funeral.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat same year after Addie\u2019s death, Lucille came home to stay with me as she was expecting the stork. But she was in such a condition we took her to Rock Springs Hospital and she gave birth to a baby boy, Demar. She had two older children, Vella and Donnie. As soon as she was able, she worked in the Ideal Caf\u00e9 for Ida. At present Ida has a maternity home and has taken care of a great many cases. We were living in our little home very comfortable when my husband\u2019s health began to fail. We did everything we could for him and took him to Salt Lake thinking the change of climate might do him good. But it was too late. We returned home on the 30th of September and he passed away that evening at 7 O\u2019clock while sitting in his chair. He had enlargement of the heart. His children were all to his funeral but Lucille and she was in Washington State and would not get here in time. I have lived alone since then but several of my children live close around. This is February 1939. I have five sons and two daughters living, one son and one daughter dead, 38 grandchildren living and 4 dead, 14 great grandchildren.\n</p>\n<p>\nMy Church Activities\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the Primary Association was first organized in Minersville, I was chosen second counselor to Mary Ann Hamblin when I was 18 years old. After I was married and had three children, I was put in President of the Y.L.M.L.A. in Minersville. I acted in that capacity for several years. Then I was Relief Society teacher there. In 1892 was chosen secretary for the Relief Society of the Minersville Ward and secretary for the Relief Society of the Minersville Ward and held that office for five years. I was Relief Society teacher for several years in Lyman, Wyoming. We moved to Elko and I was put in as Relief Society President. I acted there until we moved home and then was chosen Stake Secretary in 1919 and held that office until Addie Brough the Stake President moved to Salt Lake. I was Ward Secretary of Lyman for five years. When we moved to Green River in 1923 I acted as Ward Relief Society teacher there, then I was chosen as second counselor in the Relief Society to Mrs. Ruth Manwaring. Later I was chosen as her first counselor, and still held that position in 1932 when we moved back to Lyman.  At the present time I am Captain of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers of the Bridger Valley Camp.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nALBERT EDWARD WOOLLEY CHISHOLM\n</p>\n<p>\nI was born in London, England on June 12, 1880, but my father brought us to America when I was seven years old and my sister, Florence was five. The only thing I remember about that trip by ship was when there was a big wave; and I went with the wave. I almost went over the edge, but the man who tended the hold of the ship grabbed me and said, \"Now will you stay down in the hold when I tell you?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nWe landed down South. I remember there were a lot of colored people where I was. Our father said, \u201cYou stay right here until I get back,\u201d but when he got back it was closed and everyone was gone.  We managed to stay put at the gate outside so he found us quite easily; but he was scared to death. They have quite a \"bull pen\" they herd you into and you stay there until they tell you to move.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe came on the train right to Salt Lake City, Utah (16th ward).  We lived with my father and his sister, Aunt Emily, for a while. My father was a stage manager and dyed clothes. I was about nine years old when he passed away. I continued to live with Aunt Emily, who had four children at that time. She had several more later, several boys I believe. My sister went to live with Aunt Lottie (Giles) in Provo. I went to school in 16th ward, but not too many years (8th grade education). I didn't like it. At age 13, I had typhoid fever and lost the hearing in my left ear. We moved around half a dozen times as I remember. Then finally 1 went to Provo and went to school there.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I was 13 or 14 I got my first job with a photograph gallery on West Temple and First South. I polished the pictures and also carried picture equipment up to take pictures of Angel Moroni on top of the temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne time I was sick and Aunt and Grandma didn't know I had something like walking pneumonia. Grandma took off my shoes and that's the last thing I remember for three months. Grandma gave me whiskey and nursed me back to health. Everyday I would just drink e whiskey and two doctors would come out to check me. When I was getting better I got in the Alfalfa field and sat in the sun. Grandma gave me some new clothes and shoes.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter going to school in Provo for a while, I returned to Salt Lake City. By that time, Aunt Em's was getting quite crowded so I got a job at a floral--Evans Floral--the wife was a grey-haired lady, and he was a grey-haired, very strict Englishman. He used to give me a dime and send me to do the deliveries. He said \"If the car (street car) comes you take it and if it doesn't come you walk.\" I would walk to save the dime and run to get there faster. I also helped to design wreaths, and earned $1.50 a week. They had coal- burning heaters for their greenhouses. Later they moved to Tenth East and Fourth South to a bigger floral there, then to Denver.\n</p>\n<p>\nI moved back to Provo, where I lived with Aunt Lottie and went to public school at the old depot. Whenever I got a chance, I would draw. I would draw everything. My teacher would walk around the class, take my picture, go to the front of the class and say it was perfect. My favorite treat was Morrison Meat Pies with sauce. I used to be a fry cook at one of the restaurants there, too.\n</p>\n<p>\nA man by the name of Jepperson in Provo had a couple of sons- -1 used to go with those sons sometimes. They made guitars. This man was an artist--painted ships on curtains for when they came down in the Opera House. They let me watch them making guitars and I got interested in what they were doing.\n</p>\n<p>\nI quit Provo and moved back to Salt Lake City and started making violins. I read books and watched people and that's how I learned to make them. I lived on North Temple and Sixth West at that time with Aunt Em. Then she moved out toward Redwood Road.  They bought a lot there, and he bought some lumber and his sons put together and built a house. The built it all in one day just about.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen I went to work for a man named Dyer-- a very staunch church man. He let me run the greenhouse while he turned to other things, so I learned to tend the greenhouse rather well. I remember one time he told me to clean up the room so I cleaned the desk a put all the white, all the blue, all the pink paper together and the boss didn't want it because he couldn't find anything.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1908, I built the home I now live in and have always lived In since. (1759 Fourth East in Salt Lake City.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI learned how to play violin, clarinet, baritone trumpet, trombone, harmonica, and Auto harp. The first band I played with was the farmers Ward band for children. We played at different wards, poor people's homes and went to the old prison on 21st South.  Later I played in a band but didn't get paid so I started my own band.  This was the Chisholm Concert Band and we worked for the city playing in the park.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we were at Camp Slone, we had an orchestra. We used to go down the street and serenade; the people would feed us cake and.  things. This was Burt Rand, Charlie Walker, myself, and one or two.  others that would come and go all the time. We also used to play at Saltair. I learned to play by instruction books. I never had any lessons. We used to call Saltair Spiderville because there were so many spiders in the pavilion. They used to fall down the ladies\u2019 necks. My son Ralph used to go with me many a Sunday Afternoon. The bandleader was John Montgomery, and then I took over for eight years. This was in the \"Twenties\" or before--before the depression- -plenty of money and life was plenty good.\n</p>\n<p>\nI led the Post Office Band and in 1915 went to Los Angeles and San Francisco by train for the \"Federation Days\" held by the National Federation of Post Office Clerks. (The men were quite wayward.)\n</p>\n<p>\nI played at the dedication of the Capital Building with 145 people. After that, I went to the Mayor and said \"I won't be playing anymore because I'm going on the farm\". That was a bad decision.\n</p>\n<p>\nI did some plowing in Scipio when Ralph was eleven or twelve years old. Did it for seven years while I lived in a tent and just about broke even. I remember thinking how funny it was that down there when something was bad they said it was a piece of cheese instead of a piece of cake. I bought a tractor from Twin City (brand made in Minnesota). It had big metal wheels and I had a lot of it would only go on the road.) I plowed ant there in Scipio. I plowed 20 acres I mortgaged my home to buy the tractor, wasn't any good the mortgage stayed on.\n</p>\n<p>\nI was a cook for Knutsford Hotel until one of the cooks took a cleaver and struck the other cook with it so I left there. He hit him broadside against the face, but that was enough for me.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen I went to the Bismark on 30 West and Second South for years until 1916 when they passed the Prohibition Act. It was a Cafe and Bar where I was a cook and then a bartender until Prohibition closed the Bismark down. My boss there was Mr. Sigmund Simon, a German Jew and a very nice man. He had bartenders from all over the country that he would send for because he wanted good me to handle the bars. Later he opened a different place. My Sons, Harrold and Ralph, as children, used to go in the Bismark many times for their oyster crackers.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I left the Bismark, I took up a job setting up bowling pins downstairs from the Bismark. I was originally hired for that, but they found out I knew about cooking and soon I was in charge of all the cooking. In 1917 during the First World War, I worked as a time keeper on the Garfield-Bingham Railroad. I worked the Railroad for quite some time. I quit that and started my own cafe in 1922 on first South.\n</p>\n<p>\nI met my wife, Lovina Fitzgerald, in Provo when I was 19. She was coming around the block, and I saw this woman coming around so I went around the other way because I didn't want to meet her.  Then her sister wanted me to come and meet her at her home, so I brushed up and went out to her home. Lovina lived in Draper but was staying with her Sister Delia Fitzgerald Bonnett in Provo. Her mother was working at the insane asylum and I was carrying the food around. Her husband, Jack Bonnett, worked in a silver mine up Provo Canyon. When we returned to Salt Lake City, I would ride a bicycle from town to her home in Draper--3/4 hour on cow trails. I married Lovina at the City and County Building when she was 27 and I was 23. (Sept. 30, 1903) Laura, Clo, and Grandma went with us.  We were later sealed in the Salt Lake Temple.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne time I worked as a cook up Provo Canyon for the crew who were working on the power plant. Two fellows were the ones who started electrical energy from water in this area. They started Telluride Power Company. There still is an outfit in Colorado that carries the Telluride name, but at the time it was all through southern Utah. They had this hydroplant in Provo and I cooked for their crew. I was probably under 20 at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter they were through, I was persuaded by some guy to go over into Colorado and sell clothing. I sold suits up in Silverton, Colorado, and through that area and made more money that I had in my whole life.\n</p>\n<p>\nI've been driving a car since 1913 when I had a Model T Ford-- with straight fenders, brass radiator, window curtains, and fold- down top. When it didn't run right you would fiddle with the colls in front. The coils intensified the spark. To start it it had a crank. I remember once my son, Harrold, pushed down on the crank instead of pulling up and broke his arm. It barely got healed before he did the same thing and broke it again. I then had a Dodge, and then an old black ford--I remember I had trouble with the radiator so took it into a place to have it soldered. They soldered it up so there was no return. I got about a block away and it blew up--like a steam engine.  I never had a new car.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow I have a red, '53 Ford. What gets my goat is that my next- door neighbor, when I ran into their house by mistake and scraped a little paint off, had me arrested. The policeman came, and I told him 1 did it. He told me I would have to take some driving instructions.  The man didn't give me any instructions, just drove me around and said I should take my car home and leave it there. Then I got a letter saying I was prohibited from driving.\n</p>\n<p>\nI worked in toys, lamps, and ran the stock room at ZCMI for about 25 years from about the beginning of Second World War. I worked as custodian at night for them before I went into the stock room. I retired in 1960 at age 80, I now get retirement from them.  ($25 per month).\n</p>\n<p>\nWe had four children--Harrold, Ralph, Lois, and Vera--of which only Ralph and Vera are now living. Lois died at age 43 from cancer; and Harrold suffocated when he fell into a storage bin of insulation where he worked, one year just before Christmas.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs of this date, I have 13 grandchildren, 53 great grand- children, and 6 great, great grandchildren.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

They lived not far from the Doty family. He married the oldest daughter, Eliza. Austin and Eliza operated a prosperous farm. Austin tapped trees on his land to make maple syrup. Austin was a tall man; his wife could stand under his outstretched arm. Eliza was small in stature and had auburn hair; she was described as having a \"sweet, saintly face\" that denoted a strong character.\n</p>\n<p>\nAustin and Eliza joined the church in the spring of 1844. They sold their farm and moved to Nauvoo. Austin was assigned to help drain the swampland to make it useful to the settlers. He became ill with the malaria that was prevalent in early Nauvoo and died there, leaving Eliza with four young children.\n</p>\n<p>\nEliza was a descendant of Edward and Faith Clarke Dotey, who had sailed to America on the Mayflower, When her husband died, she was counseled by Apostle Kimball to marry again since she and her family would need help in the move West. She married her cousin William Murray, becoming his second wife in plural marriage. He confiscated her property and sold it to provide for his own family to go West. He left Eliza and her children to find their own way. (William Murray died on the trek west.)\n</p>\n<p>\nApril 30, 1848, Eliza married Alfred Brown, a widower with two small children. They remained at Council Bluffs, where Eliza gave birth to a son. They joined the wagon train of \"Warren Foote's Hundred,\" in', Kanesville, Iowa. Along the trail, Alfred died from cholera, and two days later her 17-year-old son also died. This left Eliza with three daughters, her new baby, and the son and daughter of Alfred by his first wife. Eliza was now 42 years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer family begged her to return to the east but she refused and pursued her way westward. She and her daughters yoked and hitched up the oxen and drove the team. She had a yoke of cows which not only helped pull the load but gave milk for the family. \n</p>\n<p>\nHeber C. Kimball, hearing of Alfred Brown's death, and realizing the difficulties she faced, sent word to have her drive into his yard when she reached Salt Lake, which she did September 17, 1850. Eliza married Heber for time only and lived in one of his houses until his death in 1866. Her daughter Laura later commented on the great love and respect they had for this good man. After Heber's death, Eliza spent her time in the homes of her three daughters. She was said to be \"an incessant toiler for the benefit of her family and friends, helpful and considerate of others, self-sacrificing, without enemies, faithful and true in all things and strong in her faith. \" (See source material.) She died at Laura's home in Kamas and was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

His father died when he was was 21 months old. His mother took her little family back to England to live near relatives. The family was destitute and Charles remembers attending Raikes Ragged School, a Bible school established to help poor children.  When he was ten years old, he was baptized into the LDS Church. The missionary who baptized him complained after his mission that all he had done was baptize one little ragged Irish boy. Later when he was an Apostle, Elder Callis looked up the missionary and told him he was that ragged Irish boy.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe immigrated with his mother and two little sisters to Utah through the Perpetual Emigration Fund, settling first in Bountiful and later moving to Coalville where he worked in the mines. During his hours as a lift operator, he studied the law, enabling him to pass the Bar Exam in Utah and later in Florida and South Carolina. He served in the state legislature, where he did much to alleviate the bad conditions of the miners, and as County Attorney in Summit County. He served a mission to England when he was 27.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe met Grace Elizabeth Pack when they served together in the stake MIA. Grace was a school teacher in Kamas. She had a good education and attended the Brigham Young Academy in Provo. She was only persuaded to marry Charles when he suggested on a buggy ride that they kneel in the nearby cornfield and pray about it. His pleading with the Lord convinced her. They were married when he was 37 and she was nearly 29.  Those who knew them throughout their life often talked of the loving relationship between them. They were entirely devoted to each other through all their married years. They settled in Coalville but were soon called as missionaries to the Southern States. They went to Chattanooga, Tennessee, with their two daughters. Two years later, Elder Callis was called as Southern States Mission President. They resided, first in Chattanooga and then in Atlanta. Six more children were born to them-\u2014 two boys, twins, died in infancy.\n</p>\n<p>\nElder Callis served 25 years as Mission President, travelling by train, buggy and motor car over the large area that encompassed all the Southern States. Grace served as mission Relief Society President, raised six children, boarded the missionaries, and saw to the placement of many orphan children. During their time there, over 4000 missionaries passed under their care. In those days, members had little contact with Salt Lake City, and to them Elder Callis represented the Church. He was loved and reverred by all the members in the South. Many named their children after him. He was able to dispel much hostility and prejudice against the Mormons with government officials and church leaders. He passed the bar in South Carolina in order to defend two missionaries against trumped-up charges of murder.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn General Conference, October, 1933, Charles was named as the new Apostle to take the place of Elder Talmage, a dear friend. He heard his name read from the pulpit by President Grant and that was the first he knew of it. He and Grace moved from their beloved South to the Belvedere Apartments in Salt Lake City. He traveled each weekend to a stake conference, gave radio addresses over KSL, and published a book Fundamentals of Religion. He was a favorite speaker, an old-style orator, often punctuating his talks by pounding the pulpit. In 1947, a few months after Grace had died of cancer, he fulfilled the wish of his heart, returning to his beloved South to dedicate the first stake in the Southern States at Jacksonville, Florida. The day after the dedication, he passed away quickly in mid-sentence as he was riding in the car with his dear friend Brother Jenkins.\n</p>\n<p>\nPapa and Grandmother, as we grandchildren called them, were the most wonderful grandparents. I loved them both, and Papa was to me like Santa Claus and the Lord combined. How they doted on the grandchildren and what an ever-abiding influence they were in all our lives. They gave their lives whole-heartedly to their family and to the Church. This short sketch cannot begin to do them justice. Their daughter Kathleen has written a biography which should be read in each family.  They left a heritage which we could do no better in life than to honor and emulate.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Callis and Grace Elizabeth Pack\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried: September 4, 1929\n</p>\n<p>\nErwin had happy boyhood memories of growing up at the turn of the century in the rural area of Toquerville in Southern Utah. He was the youngest of twelve children.  He rode horses, herded sheep, plowed farm- land, raided watermelon patches, (he could always pick out the best melons) and enjoyed the delicious fruits raised on the family farm.  He was the only one in his eighth grade graduating class to go to high school. He served a mission in the Netherlands, French speaking. He loved the French language and at the time of his death could still carry on conversations with native speakers. After his mission he attended the Academie L'Francais in Paris, then completed his Bachelor's at the University of Utah, where he met Josephine.\n</p>\n<p>\nJosephine was born in Chattanooga, where her parents presided over the Southern States Mission. She lived in the mission home and remembers always having missionaries at the supper table. Later this mission was moved to Atlanta, where Josephine attended Agnes Scott College; she also lived for a time with her sister Kathleen to attend New York University and studied voice at Juliard. She finished her schooling at the University of Utah, graduating in English with a French minor. The commonality of the French language between my parents afforded them much pleasure and they would often converse in French, much to the dismay of us children.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter their marriage, they moved to Preston, Idaho, where Erwin was hired to teach school. Soon the depression hit, and their circumstances were meager, but they were grateful to have a job. Erwin taught French at the high school and then, having schooled himself in Spanish to help with the Mexican laborers, he also taught Spanish. He served as principal of the junior high and later of the high school.\n</p>\n<p>\nJosephine graced the small community of Preston with her beautiful voice. She sang for various programs and for most of the funerals. We children loved to hear her sit at the piano and play jazzy songs while Daddy would sing and dance. She loved babies and was a devoted and loving mother to her five children who love and honor her.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinding it difficult to support a family on a teacher's salary, Erwin found employment with the US Gypsum Company, where he filled various positions until his retirement. The family moved from Preston to Boise to Salt Lake to Indianapolis (where Erwin served as branch president) to Chicago and then Denver. Both parents served faithfully in each new ward. Josephine taught voice and piano and continued her singing for church and public occasions. Upon his retirement, Erwin became a real estate agent. They were called to the Northeastern United States Mission where they served in Bermuda and Connecticut. At the end of their mission they moved to Provo, where they became temple workers. Their home was a haven to many, especially the grandchildren who came to BYU while Erwin and Josephine were in Provo.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir children were taught to value education and encouraged to develop their talents. Erwin established a scholarship in Mother's name for vocal students at BYU when Josephine passed away.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Haight and Eliza Ann Price\n</p>\n<p>\nMarried: 1 January 1874\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge Moroni was the third of the five surviving children of his parents.  His family moved several times, finally settling in Toquerville where he stayed for the rest of his life. He became a successful rancher and well-to-do through his industry and entrepreneurship. He owned many different tracts of land, one of which is still known as the Spilsbury Ranch on Kolob Mountain. He raised racing horses, and his riding horses sported the best trappings and saddles. One time his racehorse saved him by outracing some warring Indians. He often dressed in cowboy equipment, high-heeled boots, cowboy hat, and buckskin gloves.  He had to use a wooden bootjack to pull off his high boots.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe liked to sing and dance and played drums in the Martial Band.  On the 4th of July, he played in a fife-and-drum corps for the town celebration, riding up and down the town on a wagon, playing patriotic numbers to wake the people up early in the morning. He liked to square dance and shoddish with his wife at local dances.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe traded with the Native Americans in the region; once, to save a little orphan boy from being abandoned, he traded one of his racing horses for the boy and brought him home to his parents, who raised him. He bought goods from back East which were brought to Cedar City on the train. He met the train with horse and wagon, loaded up the goods and sold them in the Toquerville area. People in the area knew him to be fair, generous, and kind. \n</p>\n<p>\nOne great legend about him concerns some obviously haughty easterners, motoring through Toquerville. George Moroni was working at the irrigation gate when the people stopped, asking, \"Tell me my good man, what is the population of this place?\" George Moroni looked up and down the empty street and replied, \"Hell, I'm it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nHe was able to attain only a meager education, never learning to write, but saw to it that all his children attended universities and supported three of his boys and one girl on full-time missions. His wife, Roselia, also made many sacrifices to see that her children got a good education.\n</p>\n<p>\nRoselia was born into a polygamous family. She was well- educated. My father recalls her reading to him from the classics such as Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, and Shakespeare's plays. She was one of the first telegraph operators in the state and also taught telegraphy. As a mother, she was a hard-working woman, rising early to take care of household chores, baking six loaves of bread at a time, drying fruit from their orchards, bearing and caring for her twelve children and suffering the loss of five of them before they reached maturity. My father, the twelfth child, was born when she was 47 years old.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was Relief Society president when my father was born and still serving at the time of her death twenty-one years later. Her service was noted in the church's Relief Society Magazine. My father remembers going around the neighborhood each Sunday with a large pot of chicken and dumplings and bread and butter his mother had made to give to the indigents. During the Thursday evening fast and testimony meetings, when there was a large space between testimonies, it was her calling to start singing a hymn and the congregation would join in.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe died from complications of surgery when my father was on his mission. Ceorge Moroni lived some 18 years longer.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

One of his converts was a young, lady, Fanny Smith. When Fanny joined the Church and decided to travel to America, her grieving father gave her a locket, telling her, \"T can warn you that those Mormons in their wild country are ruthless and will never allow you to write and certainly never allow you to come back to me. Send me this locket as a sign and 1 will know that your are sorry and I will make it possible for you to come home!\" Fanny never returned the locket and never saw her family again. George and Fanny married and worked to earn money to immigrate to America. George worked at his trade as a bricklayer; Fanny sewed hats. They left family and beautiful homeland behind,sailing from Liverpool and arriving at New Orleans, where they had to borrow money to travel up the river to Nauvoo. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere they were acquainted with the Prophet, Joseph Smith. All his life, George bore a firm testimony of the divine calling of the Prophet.  They suffered from the persecutions by the enemies of the church and, in fact, one day a bullet whizzed by Fanny and left a hole in the washtub she was carrying. In Nauvoo, George helped quarry stone for the temple and spent much time protecting the prophet from mob violence. He was a member of Colonel Pitts Band. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum spent many hours in their home. George and Fanny viewed the martyred bodies of the Prophet and his brother; George witnessed the transformation as Brigham Young assumed the mantel of the Prophet.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey traveled across the plains to Salt Lake Valley in 1850. They had alrcady lost four children in infancy. Fanny borc her fifth child in a covered wagon as she was suffering from the effects of cholera. The birth of her baby saved her life, but she nearly lost him when the thirst-crazed oxen tumbled the wagon over in the Platte River, spilling out mother, baby, and all their belongings. The baby was found, apparently drowned, downstream among some boxes; he was quickly administered to and christened Alma Platte Spilsbury; he lived to father a great posterity.\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge and Fanny built a home in Draper but were called by Brigham Young in 1863 to help settle Utah's Dixic. They first scttled in Grafton but had to move to Rockville because of danger from the Indians.  They eventually made their home in Toquerville. My grandfather, George Moroni, was the sixth of thirteen children; only five lived to adulthood. Fanny was known as a gracious hostess to important visitors to Southern Utah. The last 12 years of her life she was impaired by a stroke and was confined to her bed and chair, but rem;ained cheerful and patient to the end.\n</p>\n<p>\nGeorge was ordained a Patriarch and was Sunday School superintendent for over fifty years. For seventeen years he rode on horseback through his area; after that he wore out three buggies and buckboards, three sets of harnesses and four horses tra veling over 30,000 miles in the Sunday school cause at his own expense.  In his later years, George lived in a small house by his son, George Moroni. My father recalls taking freshly churned buttermilk to his grandfather each evening before bedtime and then locking the door to keep him safe because he walked in his sleep. One night in his sleep, George climbed out the window and walked to the end of the road where he fell down a deep ravine. He lay in the water at the bottom which caused him to contract a fatal case of pneumonia; he died at age 95. He was stalwart in the church from the time of his conversion in England. Here is part of his personal testimony:\n</p>\n<p>\nThe question may be asked by some of my grandchildren, Did you feel disappointed when you saw him [the Prophet] the first time?' I will tell you.  All my troubles, and privations of leaving my father and mother, brothers, sisters and my native land seemed nothing compared with the joy of my experience when I first saw and heard him, the Prophet Joseph Smith, preach. I felt greatly blessed of the Lord in having such a glorious privilege.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nHistory of John Bradshaw and Ann White<br />\n(My Great Grandfather)\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw was born 14\" December 1795, at Cossall Nottinghamshire, England. The son of John Bradshaw and Olinda Hazeldine. His parents were married at Cossall, Notts, England 20 January, 1795. His father died 12 April 1796 at Cossall.  His mother remarried 27 April 1801 at Cossall to William Chambers. He grew up in this same area and became a Laborer at different trades.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe married Ann White at Heanor, Derbyshire, not far from Cossall, the 27 August 1817. His wife Ann White was born at Shipley Derbyshire, 21 May 1799, daughter of George and Mary White.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey had the following children, John White Bradshaw born 2 February 1819, in Derbyshire; Mary Bradshaw born about May 1818; Samuel Bradshaw born 6\" November 1822 at llkeston Derby; Richard Bradshaw born 28 October (about 1824); Edward Bradshaw born 15 August 1827 at St. Alkmond Parish in Derby, as was Richard; Catherine Bradshaw, christened 3 August 1829 at St. Werburgh, Derby.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann were baptized by Elder Isaac Roome, 10 August 1848 at Derby, Derbyshire England. He was 52 years old and she was 49.  They were confirmed members of the church three days later. He was ordained an Elder 31 August 1848. Their oldest son John White Bradshaw and his wife joined the church three months earlier than they did. All of their children and the in-laws were baptized into the church in 1848 and 49.. This family of Bradshaws were the first Bradshaws to join the church in Derby, Derbyshire. John Bradshaw and his wife and two unmarried children (Catherine must have died in early childhood) Mary age 32 and Samuel age 27 were emigrants from Liverpool, England. On the 1 of November, but did not set sail until 4\" of January 1851, on the ship (The Ellen). After they arrived at New Orleans, they left almost immediately and went to St. Joseph Missouri and were registered in the Membership Records of the branch there in August 1851. | would guess they were about six weeks crossing the ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\nA company of emigrating Saints at Six Mile Grove, six miles west of Winter Quarters on June 9, 1853. Danial A. Miller was made Captain, and the company was known as the Captain Danial A. Miller Company. John Bradshaw and his wife Ann White Bradshaw were among the saints listed on this company, on August 15, 1853.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis company arrived in Salt Lake City, 9 September 1853. John Bradshaw and his wife Ann were again listed with the saints who arrived in Salt Lake City with this company. They came with another family by the name of Stone John, had no property (as wagons, oxen, or horses) listed to them. This company consisted 282 people, 470 head of cattle, 70 wagons, 27 horses, 154 head of sheep, and two 2 miles.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann White Bradshaw received their endowments and were sealed in the endowment house, in Salt Lake City, 21 March 1857 by Brigham Young. The same day their son and his wife (Samuel and Mary Ann Elsie) received their endowments and were sealed also.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat happened to their daughter Mary is not known. Some say she married outside the church, which made the family so unhappy they seldom spoke of her. She was last heard of in St. Joseph Missouri where she was registered in the branch there.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw and his wife Ann went to Cedar City, Utah. For a while therein about 1857 they settled in Virgin City, Utah where they lived until they died.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn Bradshaw died 27 August 1865. His wife died 25 August 1875. It is said that John Bradshaw was a very particular man in many ways. He always did a good job, and always cleaned his tools each day. It would make him very upset if some one brought borrowed tools back dirty.\n</p>\n<p>\nDavid Bradshaw (a Grandson) told that after John died, his wife went to live with her son Samuel, and he remembers seeing her smoke a corn cob pipe. Of course, in those days there wasn\u2019t much said about keeping the word of wisdom, and she was considered a worthy member of the church. She spent her last days in helping those in need. She carried food and other things to an old Indian who had consumption and was left behind the rest of the tribe to die. She walked about a mile each week to care for him. She treated everyone with kindness.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoth John Bradshaw and his wife died in full faith in the gospel and left a great heritage. One missionary promised him he would live to sit under his own fig trees, which he did. The following taken from Deseret News, Vol. 24, Page 519.

Isaac baptized his brother Hector, who is the great, grandfather of Apostle David B. Haight. The family suffered many persecutions. Isaac said he had three homes destroyed by the mobs.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1847 they came West with the Saints.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1853, Isaac was sent to England by Brigham Young to help a company of Saints immigrate to America. In this company was a 21-year-old convert, Eliza, who had left her family to come to Utah. The ship's log reports that she became very ill on the voyage across the ocean, but recovered after having a Priesthood blessing.  Because Isaac wanted to marry Eliza, he enlisted her in a company other than his own as they crossed the plains.\n</p>\n<p>\nSoon after they arrived in Salt Lake, President Young assigned Isaac to go to Cedar City to start up the ironworks industry. He took Eliza and another woman from the immigrant party as his second and third wives, sold his home and his belongings, and took his family to settle in Cedar City. In all, Isaac had five wives and fathered many children.\n</p>\n<p>\nEliza bore ten children and raised them all to adulthood; she spent many years away from her husband, first because of his travels for the church and then because he had to live in hiding the last years of his life. An account in Isaac's diary says he bought a log house and moved it to the Springs (Pipe Springs?) where he moved Eliza to make cheese and butter.  He died when she was fifty-four years old and her youngest child was fourteen. She spent her final years in the care of her daughter Roselia, my grandmother. In her old age Eliza suffered from dementia and for her safety had to be tied with a rope; one day she ventured too close to the fireplace, catching her clothing on fire. She died from the effects of the burns.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsaac was called to help establish the Iron Mission outside Cedar City. He was the stake president at the time of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. As a result of his association with this unfortunate episode, he was excommunicated. Because of pleas on his behalf attesting to his innocence, Brigham Young personally layed his hands on Isaac's head to restore his blessings. However, wherever Isaac went, he was rejected by his people. He was forced to live away from his wives and dear children.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe and some of his family were given permission to stay in the upper rooms of the St. George Temple to do genealogy work, but a group of angry residents, stinging from the ignominy of the events at Mountain Meadows, told him to leave or his blood would stain the floors of the temple. He went to the Mormon colonies in Mexico under an assumed name, but was finally recognized and forced to leave. His trip back home from Mexico was arduous, wet and cold and he contracted pneumonia; he returned to the home of his nephew in Thatcher, Arizona, a sick and weak man and died with none of his family to comfort him.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough there was great tragedy in their lives, they were a happy family, completely dedicated to the Church. Isaac was said to be an intelligent, quick-witted, good-humored man, tall of stature and well- built. He was entrusted with great responsibilities in the colonization of Utah and the industrialization of Southern Utah; he was one of the captains in the Parley P. Pratt expedition to Southern Utah, an ardurous journey across the mountains in winter. He kept meticulous diaries about many of these events.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot much is known about Eliza during her child-raising years (perhaps raising ten children says it all). She and Isaac saw that their children were literate and well-educated. My father, Erwin Spilsbury, never knew his grandfather Isaac; he was ten years old when his grandmother, Eliza, died.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nISRAEL BARLOW &amp; LUCY HEAP HISTORY\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael is the son of Jonathan Barlow who was born June, 1, 1770 at Granville, Hamden County, Mass., and Annis Gillette who was born in 1781 at Granville, Mass. They were married October 13, 1804. The Barlow progenitors came to America in 1626, six years after the Pilgrims landed. Jonathan died Dec. 16, 1820, leaving his wife, Annis Gillette with six children. Their son Israel Barlow was fourteen years old. He was born in Granville, Mass. Sept. 13, 1806 about nine months after the Prophet Joseph Smith, only a short distance from the Prophet\u2019s home.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael met and became acquainted with the Prophet. He was baptized March 16, 1832 and became very active in the church. He was a close and trusted friend of the Prophet and acted as a member of his body guard. Upon one occasion he was asked by Joseph Smith to take an important message to the Governor of the state, a distance of thirty miles. Israel delivered the message on one of his own fine horses. The Prophet advised him to start early, told him where to feed his horse for noon, where to get his dinner and that he should stay only one hour. He also instructed him where to stay over night and said, \u201cIf you will do as I have told you, you will go and return and not be harmed.\u201d At this time many people were bitter against the Mormons. Upon his return journey he discovered he was being followed by a mob. He watched carefully so that they would not hear him. When they rode slowly, he pulled his horse in, and when they went fast, he turned his horse loose. At one time he heard them yelling so closely that he maneuvered through the brush and joined them shouting, \u201cThere he is.\u201d As they crossed a bridge he was inspired to leave the road as if to water his horse. He road off into the willows and to safety, for the mob had lost him. When Israel arrived home, the Prophet was waiting for him. Israel began telling his experience. The Prophet interrupted to say he had seen it all.  Joseph Smith also told Israel at this time there would never be a time when he would have no descendants in the church.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael later became a scout for the church and was instrumental in locating Nauvoo.  At that time it was known as Commerce and was owned by Dr. Isaac Gallasid. An additional 135 acres were purchased from a Mr. White to complete the townsite.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the building of the Nauvoo Temple, Israel hauled rock from a quarry on the east bank of the Mississippi River with his team. He was known as a fine horseman and never used a whip. One day he was met by the Prophet Joseph who asked, \u201cBrother Barlow, do you have a whip?\u201d His answer was, \u201cNo.\u201d Having learned the importance of obedience he went at once and purchased the whip. A few days later while he was backing his wagon down to the edge of the quarry, the team refused to stop at his command. He immediately gave them a swift blow with the whip which stopped them and perhaps saved his life.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael Barlow was a member of Zion\u2019s camp and Kirtland camp. He tells of one experience when he was with Zion\u2019s Camp in Missouri, while they were camped the mob came to molest the Saints but a tremendous storm of wind, rain, hail and thunder descended upon the mob with little discomfort to the Saints. The mob became disheartened and did not molest the camp any longer. Israel took part in what was called the Crooked River Battle. He felt the protection of the Lord many times. After the Saints came to Utah they organized a group called Zion\u2019s Camp in Salt Lake City and Israel with his wives attended many parties with this group.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael Barlow married Elizabeth Haven in 1840 in the Nauvoo Temple. He later Married Elizabeth Barton, in the Nauvoo Temple. Elizabeth Barton, called Betsy, was preparing to marry a Mr. Loveland when one of her parents was stricken with palsy. She did not marry at that time but remained at home and cared for her parents for ten years and after that time she married Israel Barlow at the age of 43 and lived in his family the remainder of her life. Although she was a second wife and had no children she always lived in the house of Elizabeth Haven, the first wife, where she was known and loved as Aunt Betsy.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael and his two wives were among the Saints who were driven out of Nauvoo.  They came to Utah in one of Brigham Young\u2019s companies September 23, 1848. John Haven Barlow was born July, 27, 1848 on the plains. After their arrival in Salt Lake Valley, Israel assisted others in coming to Utah from the East. He helped them to locate homes after their arrival. He pioneered Bountiful, Utah by taking a farm in North Canyon where he and his first two wives lived until their death. He was an experienced nurseryman growing a great variety of fruit trees on his farm. He also kept several stands of bees. He was one of the pioneers in the bee industry. Israel and his family experienced all the severe hardships endured by early Utah pioneers.\n</p>\n<p>\nIsrael was a seventy and one of the presidents of his quorum and was a faithful ward teacher. He was called on a mission to England in 1853. He returned from his mission in October 1855, aboard the sailing vessel \u201cChamberazo\u201d. Aboard the ship he acted as captain of fifty emigrant Saints. Among the emigrants was Lucy Heap, who was born September 24, 1836 in Litchfield, Staffordshire, England. Her parents F. James Heap, born July 20, 1794 and Sarah Waters, born August 28, 1799, lived in a small birch house with a low ceiling and a heavy wooden beam across the center of the house at 119 Stowe Street Stowe Pool and a garden was at the back of the house in which all of the family was born and reared. When Lucy was a small child, the Elders came to visit their home. She was baptized with the rest of the family when they all joined the church in the summer of 1855. When Lucy was 19 years of age, she left England, her home, family and friends to come to Utah. Her sister Emma came to Zion several years later and was the only other member of the family that came to America. Lucy sailed aboard the \u201cChamerazo\u201d. They were six weeks on the ocean and at this time she met Israel Barlow, who was returning from his mission in England. They became well acquainted while crossing the ocean and walking a thousand miles across the plains. Many people perished on this journey including her dearest friend who died of cholera. This was a great trial and test of her faith in the gospel. She arrived in Salt Lake City in October 1855 and lived with Elizabeth Palmer (or Parmer) for six weeks. On December 2, 1855 she was married to Israel Barlow by Brigham Young in his office.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy went to the farm in Bountiful to live with Israel\u2019s family. She was a strange girl in a strange land and had many lonesome homesick hours. She had married into polygamy and sometimes felt doubtful whether or not this practice was in accordance with the truth.  She prayed that she might receive a testimony of its truthfulness in bearing a son. A year and a half later, June 12, 1857, a son Truman Heap Barlow was born to her and she rejoiced for she felt this was an answer to her prayers. Now she felt it was a privilege to be able to live in polygamy. She was the mother of eight children: Truman Heap Barlow, Sarah Isabel, Annis Janette, Emma Jane, Hyrum Heap, Minnie Rette, Granville and Nathan.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy taught her children the gospel and was a teacher in the West Bountiful Relief Society. She was able to go to the temple often for endowments, sealings and baptisms for her relatives and friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor several years she lived in a one room log home. Later they built an adobe room and later added an adobe bedroom and still many years later they were able to build a brick house which they enjoyed for a long time. At the time Johnson\u2019s Army came she moved with the family and many other Saints down south and camped on the Payson bottoms. They slept under the wagons and endured many other hardships.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a long illness, Israel Barlow died November 1, 1883. When Lucy\u2019s health became poor her daughter Minnie lived with her for several years to care for her. In the summer of 1900 Lucy suffered from a paralytic stroke. Patriarch Israel Barlow II, son of Elizabeth Haven, gave her a blessing and promised her that she would become well enough to walk again. That winter she was able to walk again, could knit and could attend her church meetings. On March 21, 1901, her first great grandchild was born in Star Valley and she took a sleigh ride to see him.\n</p>\n<p>\nLucy wanted to go to Bountiful, but before she was able to leave she suffered another stroke. The children were summoned to her bedside. Her daughter Minnie Rette had just passed away in January. While all the children who could come were there, Lucy suffered another stroke. She said to her daughter Jane, \u201cDo you want to make me some nice clothes?\u201d They hadn\u2019t realized that they should make her clothes, but began sewing and had her Temple clothes nearly completed when she died the morning of July 4, 1901, at Afton, Wyoming. Her body was embalmed and they held a funeral for her in Afton at Isabel\u2019s home. The boys with Isabel took Lucy\u2019s body to Bountiful on the train. She was buried on July 6, 1901 in the Bountiful cemetery after a funeral was held in West Bountiful Ward.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Perhaps you can locate more. John Pack Was a very colorful pioneer ancestor.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn and Julia were living in New York State when his parents were converted to The Church. Not long after, being taught By Heber C. Kimball and Joseph Smith, Sr., John and Julia were baptized, and a year later they moved to Kirtland. They suffered there through many persecutions and moved with the Saints to Nauvoo. John was a major in the Nauvoo Legion. At one time the Prophet was seized by a gang of men who carried him off in a wagon. John rode furiously at the head of 24 horsemen to catch the wagon. They were able to escort the Prophet safely back to Nauvoo.\n</p>\n<p>\nJohn was chosen to be in the first pioneer company to go West to the Salt Lake Valley. He left his family at Winter Quarters. He was an advance scout for the party and participated in buffalo hunts. He had never shot a buffalo but was chosen for the hunt because, in his own words, \u201cBrigham Young thought I could do anything!\u201d John entered the Salt Lake Valley ahead of Brigham Young, who was sick. John was one of eight men who went into the valley on July 22 to begin planting crops and deciding where the people should settle. On the 24t he led the small rear company which included Brigham Young into the valley. His statue is on the \u201cThis Is the Place Monument\u201d at the mouth of Emigration Canyon.\n</p>\n<p>\nJulia was only fifteen years old when she married John. After their move to Kirtland, they endured the mob persecutions against the Church. One time, she and John were riding by wagon to visit his ill sister. A company of about 30 armed men began passing them when the leader wheeled about, rode up to the wagon and asked if they were Mormons. John said they were. The leader of the gang, a Protestant minister, ordered John to take his valise and follow them, saying, \u201cWe take you for a spy.\u201d He told Julia, \u201cYou can bid your husband goodbye. You will never see him again. Julia replied, \u201cIf my husband dies, I will die with him.\u201d But John whispered to her that she must stay there and he would be back soon. The mob took him a ways off and the leader said, \u201cWe are going to kill you unless you will deny Joe Smith.\u201d John replied: \u201cJoseph Smith is a Prophet of God. You profess to be a preacher of righteousness and so do L. I'll meet you at the Day of Judgment.\u201d None of the men in the mob seemed willing to pull the trigger. Finally a man called out, \u201cLet that damned Mormon go!\u201d John returned and they continued their journey.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause of mob activity, John and Julia moved to Far West where they built a one-room house. It was the last house of the city. There were twenty people staying in that one cold room.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1850 the University of Deseret, which later became the University of Utah, was organized in their Salt Lake home. John had seven wives and a large posterity.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

"<div>\n<i class=\"NoteType\">\nSource Note\n</i>\n<div class=\"grampsstylednote\">\n<p>\nLIFE HISTORY OF ENOS CURTIS<br />\n(As told by Brother Harward, his grandson)\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis was born in Holland, October 9th, 1783. He had a sister about two years younger than himself, whose name was Ruth. One night when Enos was about four years of age, his father came home from his work as usual and upon entering the house his wife met him with the statement, \"Enos is yours and Ruth is mine.\" A quarrel followed and finally the father picked Enos up and left the home. His father then took him to the home of a good woman who cared for him until he was fourteen years of age.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the age of fourteen years his father took him and bound him out as an apprentice to learn the carpenter trade. He was bound out for seven years.  The man was very cruel to Enos and made him work very hard. He had been with this man only about three or four years when he heard of a ship that was coming to America so he decided to run away and try to get passage on this ship. He went to the Captain and asked if he might work as a servant on the ship to earn his passage. The Captain asked him questions concerning his life and people. When he related his story the Captain told him if he desired, to be there at a certain hour the following day and he could go to America. He was at the dock at the appointed hour the following day with all his personal belongings tied up in a red handerchief.  When the ship reached America the Captain offered to let Enos remain with the ship and work for them. He had served them well and they had become very fond of him, but he would not stay.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos was the only one of his family, so far as he knew, that ever came to America. He never heard of his mother or father after he left Holland.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe later married Ruth Franklin. Her father and two brothers were in the Revolutionary War under George Washington and were all three killed in this war.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis was one of the first to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints after it was organized by Joseph Smith. He and Brother Jebediah Colton? (Zebedee Coltrin) were called on a mission in the vicinity where Brigham Young lived. They tacked up posters that they were holding meeting at a certain place. Brigham Young came to this meeting and heard them tell of this new religion and was favorably impressed. After the meeting he hurried to his home, where he had left his wife very ill at the time. He went to his room and knelt in prayer and asked the Lord if this religion was true to send these elders to his home that he might have them administer to his wife. He desired this as a testimony of the divinity of this new religion. These missionaries did come that way and as they were passing they were first impressed with the tidyness of the yards. They remarked that the man that lived there must have a lot of pride. They were next impressed to go in. Brigham Young was watching them and when they knocked he opened the door and welcomed them in. He told them how he had prayed that they would come to his home and administer to his wife that she might be healed. They asked him if he believed that she could be healed through their administration and he told them he did. They did administer to her and she was restored to her health. This was the first time Brigham Young had heard the Restored Gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the Saints started west, Enos Curtis and his wife, Ruth Franklin, started with one of the companies, but Ruth Franklin died at the Bluffs and was buried there. Enos Curtis came on to Utah and settled in Springville.  While here he became acquainted with Tammy Durfee Miner. She was the sister of Jabez Durfee and had been married to a man by the name of Miner, who had died. Enos Curtis married Tammy Miner and they had three girls, Clarissa, Malinda, and Melia. Enos Curtis later died and was buried in Springville.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnos Curtis kept a diary of his life, but after his death the Miner boys used it for smoking paper and thus destroyed this valuable record.\n</p>\n<p>\nP.S. Grandpa Harward's memory is surely keen and he relates so many incidents that has witnessed and also that he has heard others relate, in such a clear, concise way that one cannot help believing they are true. I have heard him relate incidents at different times, with long intervals between, and the facts are always the same.  (Lue Cutis Lazenby)\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

She was well built physically, well proportioned as she weighed about 200 pounds. She possessed wonderful auburn hair, and took pride in it, and in a manner in which it was to be dressed. She always had it in ringlets and curls all about her head. She did it so until after her 4th child was born.  Then styles changed and she dressed it in the coming mode.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe was gentle and mild having a feeling she could not be unkind with any of her children even to correct them. She was loving, affectionate and generous.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was regretable that she passed away enroute to Salt Lake City as founding anew home and rearing the children in a new country, with the customs and conditions so different needed a mother and her care. The young women just budding into womanhood needed the advice and love of a thoughtful mother. This was denied them as well as the boys who were very young, especially some of them. However, the new wife, Caroline Woodhall, did her best as she saw it. She had never been a mother and had not experienced a mother's love and anxious moments. She tried to do her part by these children who lost their mother out in the wilds of America.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe wild grass waves, and the wild sighs mournfully over the graves of a wonderful Mother and her 2 daughters who shall have those resting spots until the trump shall sound and the resurrection of the just and true shall be consummated.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn June 1852, Joseph Howard, son James and daughter Emma all journeyed to St. George, Utah, and did the temple work, including all ordinances for Ann Shelton Howard.\n</p>\n<p>\nCaroline Richards Woodall Howard\n</p>\n<p>\nDied March 3, 1912, Layton, Utah when she was 83 years old at the home of her step daughter, Emma Corbridge.\n</p>\n<p>\nHer funeral was held in South Bountiful, Utah, at the ward chapel.

He was the son of Robert Flint and Ann Wilson Poll. His father was a cabinet-maker. Grandfather at the early age of eight began learning his father's trade.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandmother was born and reared in Wymondham, a thrifty little town a few miles southwest of Norwich. Her birthday was June 29, 1823. Her parents were John and Elizabeth Minns Long. They kept a public house and butcher shop. Grandmother was a butcher and an efficient meat cutter.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and Grandmother made their home in Lowestoft, and old, old town in the northern part of Suffolk near the salt marshes along the eastern coast of England. This town was originally inhabited by the Danes who named it Lowestoft, meaning the low place to the east.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandmother liked Lowestoft, and was very happy there until grandfather began drinking too much. \"'alf and 'alf\" and a bit of rum, but grandmother like the devoted wife she always was, made it a point to meet him each night after work at Bowling Green and walked home with him, thus avoiding the grog shops.\n</p>\n<p>\nElizabeth their first child was born and died at Lowestoft, then they moved to Wymondham where William John and Ann Marie were born. Later they moved to Great Ellenford and Fredrick Robert was born there.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time Grandfather and Grandmother after thoroughly investigating the principles of Mormonism as taught by the L.D. S.  Missionaries, joined the Church and were baptized December 15, 1848.  At that time all converts were urged to come to Utah and settle among the saints. Grandfather and Grandmother were very anxious, but because of their financial condition, they were unable to make the journey, so they lived their religion and attended Church services in Norwich.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the fall of 1852 Granfather's friend Robert T. Neslen, who was very well to do, offered to pay their emigration expenses for the whole Poll family if Grandfather would build for him (Neslen) in Salt Lake City. Grandfather gladly accepted the offer and preparation for the trip were made. Soon after the joyous Yuletide, they said \"Goodbye\" to their many loved ones and were on their way. At the dock there was some difficulty with the presiding Elder of the Company, Jacob Gates, over Grandfather bringing his chest of tools. They sailed from Liverpool on the ship Golconda, January 23, and arrived in New Orleans on March 26, 1853.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder the direction of John Brown, Emigration Agent at New Orleans, they transhipped and continued up the Mississippi River to Keokuk, Iowa, a place which had been selected as the outfitting post for the Saints crossing the plains that year. They stayed in Keokuk a few weeks where they obtained oxen and wagons, food supplies and equipment necessary for the trip westward which they began in the latter part of May. One day they came a large stream which they had to cross on a raft. Elder Gates said, \"well, Brother Poll, will you get your tools and help build a raft?\" Grandfather was delighted to say, \"If you had your way, I would not have had any tools.\" .\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir company suffered all manner of hardships incidental to life on the Great Plains and arrived in Salt Lake City in September. Grandfather soon began work on the house for his friend, Neslen (Nelsen)\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and Grandmother made their home upon the hill in the 20th Ward. They did not have much of a house and like many other people at that time they used their covered wagon box for a bedroom. On { August 4, 1854, Elizabeth Jennette, their !  third daughter was born. when she was five | &amp; days old a dreadful rainstorm washed the \u2018 wagon box with it's occupants down on the 8th ward square, the block on which the City and County Building now stands, but no further damage was done. Three other daughters, Martha Ann, Mary Ann and Alice Eliza were born while they lived in the 20th ward.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather and family were among the families that were called by President Brigham Young to go south and settle the country known as Dixie. This was a five-year mission and Grandfather's duty August 1873 was to make furniture.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1861, the Poll family located on a small acreage in the Grafton Ward near the Virgin River. They lived in one adobe room.  Grandfather enclosed the lot with a woven willow fence about 2 1/2 or 3 feet high. Part of the lot near the front of the house was used as a calf pasture. One day the children were playing in this little pasture when Grandmother saw a panther leap over the low fence and take a calf. She was always thankful that it was a calf instead of one of the children.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe people in Utah's Dixie had a bad year in 1865. The Country suffered from a heavy drought. Food stuff was very, very scarce and people in some places suffered from hunger.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn one occasion, when Grandmother had used the last of her flour in making a few precious biscuits which she had baking in a bake oven, a tall distinguished-looking man, exceptionally well dressed in a dark suit of clothes, came to the door and asked for bread. She told him if he would wait until the bread was done she would divide it with him. He waited and when she gave him the bread he blessed her and told her she would never want for bread. He walked down the path as far as the gate. There was nothing to obstruct the view except \u2014 the low willow fence. Grandmother and the children looked for him but he had completely vanished. She always said he was one of the Three Nephites. About this time Grandfather was awfully worried.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe did not know what to do to provide bread for his family, and being a man of great faith, he made it a matter of prayer. He was inspired to go down to the Virgin River, cut &amp;cottonwood trees and burn them, take the ashes to Toquerville where he would get flour. He followed this inspiration and to his satisfaction he exchanged a sack of ashes for a sack of flour with the people there who were using ashes for making soap in their new soap factory. He returned home with bread stuff for his thankful family. Grandfather and Grandmother were blessed while they lived in Grafton by the arrival of two more children, Harriet and Charles Henry. A great sorrow came into their lifes when their daughter Maria, wife of Joseph Gibson, died-leaving him and two children.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir mission was completed in 1866. Grandfather and his family left the Dixie country and returned to Salt Lake City. They made their home in the 10th Ward. Their house was two large rooms on the corner of 4th South and 10th East. Their son Joseph was born there.  In the summer of 1869 they sold this little home and moved into a comfortable adobe house on the corner of 4th South and 9th East.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather worked a number of years making furniture for the Dinwoodey Furniture Company. Then for some time he worked on the Salt Lake Temple. His wages being partly cash and partly commodities from the Church Tithing Office.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbout this time the Poll family was deeply grieved by the death of the eldest son and brother William J., who left a wife Louise Strong Poll and two small children.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir three elder girls of the family had a hat shop on the corner of Grandfather's lot where they prepared straw, braided it, made hats and sold them. After the girls were married Grandfather used the shop as a carpenter shop. During this time he became very seriously ill and for sometime he was unable to work.\n</p>\n<p>\nLater on through Grandmothers influence he opened a Meat Market in the old carpenters shop where he and Grandmother worked together.  After the children were married grandfather sold the home and Meat Market and moved into a little house just around the corner on 9th East. Like all her homes, Grandmother kept it very cozy and homey, and one of the greatest joys of our lives was to visit there.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe affectionate welcome and hospitable influence of the home was unsurpassed. It was here in the evening of November 3, 1892, that Grandfather and Grandmother celebrated their Golden Wedding.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey were happy and proud to greet such a large gathering of their children and Grandchildren. All enjoyed a lovely dinner and an extemporaneous program. A gold headed cane and a gold headed umbrella with suitable inscriptions engraved therein was presented to the elderly couple who cherished these gifts as long as they lived. Years before Grandfather laid off the liquor and tobacco habits.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe and Grandmother were contended and happy. Their home life was simple and pleasant. They were prosperous in business, active in Church affairs, and sincere in their religious belief. In later life they did some temple work.\n</p>\n<p>\nGrandfather died November 7, 1895. Funeral services were held Sunday, November 10th in the 10th Ward Chapel and he was buried in the City Cemetery. Dear little brokenhearted Grandmother just could not live in the old home without Grandfather, so she broke up house keeping and lived with one of her daughters for the balance of her life. Another sorrow came into her life when her daughter Jennette passed away leaving her husband Joseph Earl and a large family. Grandmother died February 19, 1903 at the home of her daughter Harriet in South Weber. After her funeral services in Salt Lake in the 10th ward Chapel she was laid to rest by the side of Grandfather. At this time June 15, 1940 there are 303 living descendants.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll credit for this sketch can be given to Lizzie Poll Berrett and Ida Berrett Poll.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

The family was driven by mobs into Far West; mobs placed guards in front of their dooryard to prevent Mormons from going in and out of town. Ward would crawl through a crack between the logs in the back of the house to escape the guards.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe family moved to Nauvoo where he was baptized in the font of the Nauvoo Temple. He saw the Prophet Joseph Smith many times--saw him playing and wrestling, dressed in his military uniform, drilling the legion, preaching, and in disguise to fool his enemies. One day Ward was sent to the Smith home on an errand and the Prophet insisted that Ward sit and eat breakfast with him. He stood by the side of the road when the bodies of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum were being brought back from Carthage.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen he was fourteen, he drove a team of two yoke of oxen and one yoke of cows across the plains. When his father was called on a mission to France, the responsibility of providing for the family was placed upon Ward. At the age of nineteen, he was married to Elizabeth Still by Brigham Young.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn April conference of 1854 he was called on a mission to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). When he returned, his wife was very ill and died shortly after. He soon married Laura Cravath, Elizabeth's best friend. In 1870, he moved the family to Kamas where he and Laura worked with other families in the manufacturing of cheese. He was called on a second mission to the Sandwich Islands. Even while on his mission, he was appointed second counselor in the Summit Stake presidency, a position he held for twenty--two years. In 1884 he lost the bottom part of his right arm in a machinery accident. He learned to write with his left hand, build houses, break horses, and do every kind of farm work in spite of the handicap.\n</p>\n<p>\nLaura's parents joined the church when she was very young and moved to Nauvoo. When she was four years old her father died of malaria while helping clear the swamps. She was only ten years old when she and her thrice-widowed mother, two sisters and baby brother came across the trail to Utah. She helped drive the team of oxen.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs she reached maturity, she was very attractive, and received forty proposals to enter into polygamy. She resolved never to marry but to stay with her mother and take care of her. Her dearest friend Elizabeth was married to Ward Pack, who was on a mission. She said to Laura, \"Laura, don't marry until Ward comes home, then marry him for I would rather share him with you than anyone else. \" Three months after Elizabeth died, Ward and she were married by Heber C. Kimball. Her wedding dress was a new soft, brown-checked gingham.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe learned to card wool, spin it, dye it and weave it into cloth. She made her husband a suit from raw wool. They lived in Kamas for thirty- eight years. They had a large log room with dirt floor and a lean-to for a kitchen. Each spring she white-washed the log walls and wove 35 yards of bright, striped rag carpet which she fastened to the earth with wooden pegs.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe loved to read and found time to read in the evening doing the churning, sitting with a book in one hand and working the dasher up and down with the other. She wrote poetry. She was the mother of eleven children; her first daughter died while Ward was serving in the Sandwich Islands. When her last child was a few days old, her husband's plural wife died and left a family of four which she took into her home. About a month later, her sister-in-law passed away and left a tiny baby which Laura nursed and cared for with her own baby. A few years later, her husband's sister died in childbirth and she took the young baby and mothered it for nine months at which time it died. After her large family was grown, a younger plural wife died and left two boys, these she also took into her home and reared and mothered them. These children loved and honored her all her life.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter her husband, and two grown sons died, she moved to Salt Lake City to be near her children.. She spent these last years doing Temple work which gave her much joy and happiness.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
